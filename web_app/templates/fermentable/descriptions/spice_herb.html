<p>In the brewing process, spices and herbs serve both as flavoring agents and potential fermentables that contribute to the complexity of the final product. Herbs like coriander, chamomile, or lemongrass, and spices such as cloves, cinnamon, or pepper can impart unique aromatic and taste profiles, enhancing the sensory complexity of beer. They can be added during different stages of brewing - in the boil, during fermentation, or post-fermentation - each of which yields distinct flavor outcomes.</p>

<p>Spices and herbs can also act as fermentables, meaning the yeast can consume the sugars present in them and convert these into alcohol and carbon dioxide. While they do not usually contribute significantly to the overall alcohol content due to their relatively low sugar content, they can impact the depth and character of the beer. Certain herbs and spices also contain antimicrobial compounds, which can inhibit undesirable microbial growth during fermentation, contributing to the stability and shelf life of the final product.</p>
