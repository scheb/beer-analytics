<p>Grain fermentables, including malts and unmalted grain adjuncts, play a central role in the beer brewing process. Malted grains (most commonly barley) undergo a process of soaking in water, sprouting, and drying in a kiln to produce malt, which is rich in the enzymes needed to convert grain starches into fermentable sugars. These sugars, when added to the brew and fermented by yeast, provide the alcohol content and contribute significantly to the beer's flavor profile. The degree of malt roasting also influences the color and taste of the beer, with darker roasts producing stouts and porters, and lighter roasts used in beers like pilsners and pale ales.</p>

<p>Unmalted grain adjuncts on the other hand are used to modify the flavor, color, and body of the beer, or to reduce cost. Since they lack the necessary enzymes to convert their starches into fermentable sugars, they are typically used in conjunction with malted grains. Some styles of beer, such as <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/american-lager/">American lagers</a> or Belgian <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">witbiers</a>, traditionally include a significant proportion of these adjuncts, while others rely predominantly on malted barley. Thus, the use of malted and unmalted grains helps determine the characteristics of the final beer, offering a vast range of possibilities for brewers to explore.</p>
