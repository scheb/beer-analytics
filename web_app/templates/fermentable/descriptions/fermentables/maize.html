<p><em>Maize</em>, also known as corn, is widely used in beer brewing due to its unique flavor profile and properties. It adds a subtle sweetness and smoothness to the taste of beer, making it a popular choice for brewers looking to create well-balanced and refreshing brews. <em>Maize</em> serves as an adjunct in the brewing process, meaning it is added alongside malted grains like barley or wheat.</p>

<p><em>Maize</em> contributes to a lighter body and color while enhancing drinkability by reducing bitterness. Its natural sugars are converted into alcohol during fermentation, resulting in a clean and crisp finish. Additionally, <em>Maize</em> helps improve head retention in beers by providing proteins that aid in foam formation. <em>Maize</em> finds application across various beer styles such as <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/american-lager/">American lagers</a>, <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/cream-ale/">cream ales</a>, Mexican-style lagers (like Corona), and even some Belgian <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">witbiers</a>. These styles benefit from the inclusion of <em>Maize</em> as it imparts their characteristic lightness and easy-drinking nature.</p>
