<p><em>CaraFa I</em> is a roasted grain that is widely used in beer brewing for its unique flavor profile and ability to influence the taste of beer. It imparts a rich, smooth, and slightly sweet flavor to the brew, adding depth and complexity. This roasted grain is typically used in darker beers such as stouts, porters, or <a href="/styles/dark-european-lager/schwarzbier/">schwarzbier</a> where it contributes to their distinctively dark color and malty character.</p>

<p>With its black color and roasted properties, <em>CaraFa I</em> provides not only an intense hue but also a pleasant bitterness that balances out the sweetness of malted grains. Its high level of melanoidins brings notes of chocolate, coffee, and caramel into the beer's flavor profile. Brewers often use <em>CaraFa I</em> sparingly because too much can lead to overpowering flavors or excessive dryness in the final product.</p>
