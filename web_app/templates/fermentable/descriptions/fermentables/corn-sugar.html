<p><em>Corn Sugar</em>, also known as dextrose or corn syrup solids, is a fermentable sugar commonly used in beer brewing. It has a subtle and clean flavor profile that adds sweetness without imparting any distinct taste of its own. When added to the brewing process, <em>Corn Sugar</em> increases the alcohol content of beer while lightening its body and mouthfeel.</p>

<p>In addition to boosting alcohol levels, <em>Corn Sugar</em> is often used for priming during bottle conditioning. This involves adding a small amount of sugar to fermented beer before bottling, which creates carbonation through secondary fermentation. <em>Corn Sugar</em>'s high fermentability makes it an ideal choice for this purpose as it quickly converts into CO2 without leaving residual sweetness behind.</p>

<p>The properties of <em>Corn Sugar</em> include its solubility in water, rapid fermentation rate by yeast, and ability to contribute lighter flavors and textures to beers. Its use is particularly common in <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/american-lager/">American lagers</a> such as Budweiser or Coors where it helps create crispness and dryness but can also be found in various other styles like <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/cream-ale/">cream ales</a> or <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/blonde-ale/">blonde ales</a> that benefit from increased drinkability and enhanced clarity provided by <em>Corn Sugar</em>s' characteristics.</p>
