<p><em>Orange</em> is a versatile fruit that lends its unique flavor profile to beer brewing. With its bright, citrusy aroma and sweet yet tangy taste, <em>Orange</em> adds a refreshing twist to the traditional beer recipes. The distinct flavor of <em>Orange</em> can greatly influence the overall taste of beer, enhancing it with zesty notes that complement various styles.</p>

<p>In beer brewing, <em>Oranges</em> are primarily used for their zest or juice. The essential oils found in the peel bring out vibrant citrus flavors when added during different stages of fermentation or conditioning. <em>Orange</em> zest can infuse beers with hints of bitterness and acidity while also imparting a pleasant fragrance. Additionally, using <em>Orange</em> juice in certain beer styles can contribute natural sugars and acids that aid in fermentation.</p>

<p>The properties of <em>Oranges</em> make them an ideal ingredient for numerous beer styles such as Belgian <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">witbiers</a>, pale ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> (<a href="/styles/ipa/">India Pale Ales</a>), and even sour beers like <a href="/styles/historical-beer/gose/">gose</a> or <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/berliner-weisse/">Berliner weisse</a>. Witbiers often feature pronounced <em>Orange</em> character due to the addition of both zest and sometimes juice during brewing processes. In hop-forward styles like IPAs, adding <em>Orange</em> peel can provide an extra layer of complexity to balance out the intense hoppiness.</p>
