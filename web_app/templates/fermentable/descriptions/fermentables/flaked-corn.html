<p><em>Flaked Corn</em> is commonly used in beer brewing as an adjunct to enhance the overall flavor profile of the brew. Its mild and subtle flavor allows it to blend well with other ingredients, resulting in a smooth and crisp taste. It contributes a light sweetness and creamy mouthfeel to the beer, making it popular for use in lagers and lighter-bodied beers.</p>

<p>In addition to influencing the taste of beer, flaked corn also plays a crucial role in improving fermentation efficiency. The high amount of starch present in corn helps to provide fermentable sugars that yeast can easily convert into alcohol during the brewing process. This not only aids in achieving higher alcohol content but also imparts a cleaner finish to the beer.</p>

<p>Due to its properties as an unmalted adjunct grain, flaked corn offers brewers more control over their recipes by providing additional fermentables without adding excessive color or strong flavors. It is often used alongside malted grains like barley or wheat to create balanced recipes for American-style lagers, <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/cream-ale/">cream ales</a>, pilsners, and even some light-bodied <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>. The use of flaked corn adds complexity while maintaining drinkability in these styles by contributing both texture and delicate notes of sweetness.</p>
