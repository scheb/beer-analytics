<p><em>Maltodextrin</em>, a sugar derived from starch, is commonly used in beer brewing as a way to enhance body and mouthfeel. It has a neutral flavor profile, meaning it does not add any noticeable taste or aroma to the beer. Instead, <em>Maltodextrin</em> primarily influences the texture of the beer by increasing its viscosity and providing a fuller mouthfeel.</p>

<p>In addition to improving body and mouthfeel, <em>Maltodextrin</em> serves various purposes in beer brewing. It can be used to increase the alcohol content without adding excessive sweetness or flavor. <em>Maltodextrin</em> also aids in head retention by providing proteins that stabilize foam formation. Furthermore, it acts as an adjunct ingredient that helps balance out <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> flavors in hop-forward beers.</p>

<p>The properties of <em>Maltodextrin</em> make it highly suitable for use in different styles of beer. Its ability to boost body and improve mouthfeel makes it particularly popular in heavier styles such as stouts and porters where richness is desired. However, it can also be utilized in lighter styles like pale ales or lagers when brewers want to add substance without altering the overall character too much.</p>
