<p><em>Malt Extract</em>, available in dried (DME) or liquid (LME) form, has transformed the beer brewing process, making it accessible to more hobbyists. This is because the malt extract provides a convenient alternative to the traditional all-grain brewing method. <em>Malt Extract</em> is derived from malted grains, usually barley, where the sugars have been extracted and then either concentrated into a syrup (LME) or dehydrated into a powder (DME). This method eliminates the need for mashing, a time-consuming process used in all-grain brewing to extract fermentable sugars from malted grains.</p>

<p>However, using malt extract over traditional grain malt can impact the final product. While malt extract can expedite the brewing process and often create a more consistent brew, all-grain brewing allows for greater control over the beer's flavor, color, and overall characteristics. Craft and professional brewers typically prefer the traditional grain malt method due to the increased scope for creativity and individuality it provides in beer creation. That said, malt extract brewing serves as a valuable entry point into the craft for newcomers, offering a less labor-intensive and less error-prone method while still producing quality beer.</p>
