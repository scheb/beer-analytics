<p><em>Lactose</em>, also known as milk sugar, is a commonly used ingredient in beer brewing. It adds a distinct flavor profile to the finished product with its subtle sweetness and creamy texture. <em>Lactose</em> is unfermentable by yeast, meaning it remains in the final beer without being converted into alcohol during fermentation. This not only enhances the body and mouthfeel of the beer but also provides a smooth and velvety finish.</p>

<p><em>Lactose</em> contributes a mild sweetness that balances out bitterness from hops or roasted malts in certain styles of beer. It is often used to create sweeter and richer brews like milk stouts or <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/cream-ale/">cream ales</a>. The addition of <em>Lactose</em> can give these beers an added complexity and depth while enhancing their overall drinkability.</p>

<p>Aside from influencing taste, <em>Lactose</em> has unique properties that make it useful in brewing. Its unfermentable nature means it can be added at various stages of the brewing process without affecting primary fermentation or carbonation levels. Brewers typically add <em>Lactose</em> during boiling or post-fermentation to achieve desired sweetness levels.</p>
