<p><em>Cane Sugar</em> is commonly used in beer brewing for its ability to enhance the flavor profile of the brew. It imparts a sweet and slightly caramelized taste to the beer, adding depth and complexity to its overall flavor. This sweetness can help balance out <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> or hoppy flavors, resulting in a more well-rounded brew.</p>

<p>In addition to enhancing the taste of beer, <em>Cane Sugar</em> also serves as a fermentable ingredient that provides extra fuel for yeast during fermentation. As yeast consumes the sugars present in <em>Cane Sugar</em>, it produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, contributing to both the ABV (alcohol by volume) and carbonation levels of the finished beer.</p>

<p><em>Cane Sugar</em> is typically used in lighter-bodied beers such as pale ales, lagers, pilsners, and certain Belgian styles like tripels and <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>. Its properties include being highly fermentable and easily dissolved into wort (unfermented beer), making it convenient for brewers to use during various stages of brewing.</p>
