        <em>Beer Analytics</em> is a <strong>database of beer brewing recipes</strong>, specifically designed for data
        analysis. The database currently contains <strong>{{ recipes }} recipes</strong>, mostly from the home-brewing
        community. The goal of this project is to expand the knowledge how different beer styles are typically brewed and
        potentially uncover trends in craft-/home-brewing.

    <p>
        Created by beer enthusiast and software engineer <a href="https://www.schebräu.de/">Christian Scheb</a>,
        who was &ndash; while doing home-brewing as a hobby &ndash; feeling the need to get better insights how certain
        beers are composed, ultimately to make better decisions when creating his own recipes.
