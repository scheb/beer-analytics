    <p>
        <em>Beer Analytics</em> is a <strong>database of beer brewing recipes</strong>, built specifically for data
        analysis. The database currently contains <strong>{{ recipes }} recipes</strong>, mostly from the homebrewing
        community.
        It is made for beer enthusiasts and (home)brewers to provide detailed insights into brewing recipes, even when
        they're not an expert in data analysis. The goal is to expand the knowledge how certain types of beer are
        typically brewed, ultimately helping (home)brewers to compose better recipes themselves, and potentially uncover
        some trends in craft/home brewing.

    <p>
        It as created by beer enthusiast, homebrewer and software engineer
        <a href="https://www.schebräu.de/">Christian Scheb</a>, who was feeling the need to get better insights how
        certain beers are composed, other than clicking through dozens of recipes. After starting a
        <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> data analysis project for himself in August 2020, he decided build a
        website from it, so other homebrewers can benefit from these insights alike.
