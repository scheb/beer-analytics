    <p>
        <em>Beer Analytics</em> is a <strong>database of beer brewing recipes</strong>, built specifically for data
        analysis. The database currently contains <strong>{{ recipes }} recipes</strong>, mostly from the homebrewing
        community.
        It is made for beer enthusiasts and (home)brewers to provide detailed insights into brewing recipes, even when
        they're not an expert in data analysis. The goal is to expand the knowledge how certain types of beer are
        typically brewed, ultimately helping (home)brewers to compose better recipes themselves, and potentially uncover
        some trends in craft/home brewing.
    </p>
    <p>
        It as created by beer enthusiast, homebrewer and software engineer
        <a href="https://www.schebr√§u.de/">Christian Scheb</a>, who was feeling the need to get better insights how
        certain beers are composed, other than clicking through dozens of recipes. After starting a
        <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> data analysis project for himself in August 2020, he decided build a
        website from it, so other homebrewers can benefit from these insights alike.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <dl class="faq">
        <dt>Where are the recipes from?</dt>
        <dd>
            The recipes are gathered from various homebrewing communities online and historical archives. The database
            is regularly updated with new recipes on a daily basis. For details on the origins of these recipes, please
            refer to the &quot;Brewing Recipes&quot; sections across various pages.
        </dd>

        <dt>Can I have a copy of your recipe database?</dt>
        <dd>
            Thank you for your interest in our recipe collection! However, I am not able to redistribute the recipes.
            Each recipe in our database is the creative and intellectual property of its respective author, and it's
            important for us to respect their rights, as well as the usage rights of their communities.
            While I can't provide a direct copy of the recipe database, I encourage you to explore the
            &quot;Brewing Recipes&quot; sections on our platform. There you'll find links to the original sources of
            these recipes. This way, you can access them directly and also support the authors and communities by
            visiting their own websites or publications.
        </dd>

        <dt>How do you handle duplicates in the database?</dt>
        <dd>
            At present, the approach to handling duplicates is: we don't actively manage them. This decision was made
            after quality checks and analysis of our database. It showed that duplicates do not pose a significant
            issue, so time was better spent towards enhancing other features that more directly impact user experience
            and system performance.
