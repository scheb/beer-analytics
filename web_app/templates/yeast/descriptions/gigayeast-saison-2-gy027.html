<p>GigaYeast's <em>Saison #2</em> (GY027) is a liquid ale yeast strain that offers brewers a highly versatile fermentation profile. With an attenuation rate of 81.0%, it provides brewers with balanced malt and hop flavors as well as a rich, complex flavor profile. This yeast strain also has low flocculation, meaning that it will stay in suspension throughout the fermentation process and produce fewer break materials, resulting in cleaner beer. For optimal results, GigaYeast recommends fermenting this strain at temperatures between 18.0-27.0Â°C, though some experimentation may be necessary if brewing in cooler climates.</p>
