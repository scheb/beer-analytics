<p>The <em>Yorkshire Square Ale</em> (WLP037) from White Labs is a liquid ale yeast with high flocculation and medium alcohol tolerance. It has an attenuation of 70%, which means that it will convert a high amount of the sugars present in the wort into alcohol. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain of yeast is 18.0-21.0Â°C, perfect for producing a well balanced, full-bodied beer with subtle fruity notes.</p>
