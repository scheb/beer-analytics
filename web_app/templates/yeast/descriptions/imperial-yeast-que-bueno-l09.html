<p>Imperial Yeast’s <em>Que Bueno</em> (L09) is a liquid lager yeast strain, ideal for those looking to brew crisp, clean lagers. It has an attenuation of 73.0%, meaning that it will create a beer with a good balance between sweetness and dryness. Flocculation of this strain is medium, meaning that the yeast settles out quickly and easily from the wort during fermentation. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain ranges from 8-13°C, so brewers should aim to keep their fermenter within this range in order to get the most out of this strain.</p>
