<p><em>Brettanomyces</em>, often referred to as <em>Brett</em>, is a genus of yeast that imparts unique flavors and aromas to beer, including notes of barnyard, earth, leather, fruit, or even the characteristic “horse blanket” smell. This yeast has a slower metabolism and is more resilient than traditional brewing yeasts like Saccharomyces. It can ferment complex sugars and can survive in high-alcohol environments, allowing it to change beer flavors over extended aging periods.</p>

<p>In comparison, bacteria such as <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Pediococcus</em> are also used in brewing for their souring abilities. They produce lactic acid, which gives beer a distinct tart or sour taste. Unlike traditional brewing yeasts, these bacteria work under different conditions, such as anaerobic environments, and do not produce alcohol.</p>

<p>The utilization of <em>Brettanomyces</em> and bacteria significantly differs from standard brewing yeasts like <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, often used for <a href="{% url "yeast_type" "ale" %}">ale production</a>, or <em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em>, used for <a href="{% url "yeast_type" "lager" %}">lager brewing</a>. These yeasts typically ferment more quickly and predictably, and contribute less &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;funky&quot; flavors to the beer. Brett and bacteria are commonly used in brewing styles such as <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/lambic/">Lambics</a>, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/gueuze/">Gueuze</a>, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/flanders-red-ale/">Flanders Red Ale</a>, and <a href="/styles/american-wild-ale/">American Wild Ales</a>. These styles embrace the complex, funky, and sour flavors these microorganisms contribute to, which over time, can result in a beer with remarkable depth and complexity. They are key to the creation of these traditional and innovative beer styles.</p>
