<p>Lager yeast, scientifically known as <em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em>, is unique in many ways when compared to other yeasts used in beer brewing. This type of yeast is distinguished by its ability to ferment at colder temperatures, usually around 8 to 12 degrees Celsius, which is lower than <a href="{% url "yeast_type" "ale" %}">ale yeasts</a> that ferment at higher temperatures. This difference results in a slower, more extended fermentation process, often taking weeks rather than days. Lager yeast also ferments at the bottom of the fermentation vessel, hence the term "bottom-fermenting," while ale yeast is top-fermenting. Additionally, lager yeast produces fewer fruity and spicy esters and phenols than ale yeast, leading to a cleaner, crisper taste that allows the malt and hops in the beer to take center stage.</p>

<p>Lager yeast is typically used in brewing various types of lager beers, including Pilsners, Bocks, <a href="/styles/strong-european-beer/doppelbock/">Doppelbocks</a>, <a href="/styles/amber-malty-european-lager/maerzen/">MÃ¤rzens</a> (Oktoberfest beers), and Dortmunders, among others. These styles showcase the lager yeast's ability to create beers with clean, smooth, and well-rounded flavors, which contrast with the often more complex and robust flavors found in ales. Despite its slow and temperature-specific fermentation process, the qualities of lager yeast have made lager the most widely consumed and commercially available type of beer in the world.</p>
