<p>The <em>Skare Kveik</em> Ale Yeast by Escarpment Labs is a liquid yeast strain ideal for producing some of the most popular ale styles. This strain has a low flocculation, resulting in beers with a soft mouthfeel and light body. It is capable of achieving an attenuation of up to 76%, making it well suited for higher gravity ales. The alcohol tolerance for this strain is low, so brewers should be aware that beers with higher ABV may not reach full attenuation. For optimal results, this strain should be fermented between 18-30Â°C.</p>
