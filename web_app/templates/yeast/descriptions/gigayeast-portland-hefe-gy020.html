<p>The <em>Portland Hefe</em> (GY020) liquid ale yeast from GigaYeast is a great choice for those looking to brew a hefeweizen. It has an attenuation of 78%, meaning that it will convert most of the sugars present in your wort into alcohol, giving you a tasty, robust beer. The flocculation of this strain is low, meaning that it won't drop out of solution easily which can lead to a clearer beer and more complex flavors. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is between 18-23Â°C, so make sure your fermentation chamber is set up correctly before pitching.</p>
