<p>White Labs' <em>Super High Gravity Ale</em> (WLP099) is a liquid ale yeast type with an attenuation of 85.0%, medium flocculation, and high alcohol tolerance. This yeast works best in the temperature range of 18.0-21.0°C, making it a great choice for brewing high gravity beers like Barleywines and <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Imperial IPAs</a>. The flavor profile of these beers will be rich and complex with notes of dried fruit, dark chocolate, and toffee, which is perfect for those that appreciate strong malt flavors. This yeast can also be used to brew <a href="/styles/scottish-ale/">Scottish Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/old-ale/">Old Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/trappist-ale/belgian-dubbel/">Belgian Dubbels</a>, <a href="/styles/trappist-ale/belgian-tripel/">Belgian Tripels</a>, and more – making it an incredibly versatile choice for any high ABV beer recipe!</p>
