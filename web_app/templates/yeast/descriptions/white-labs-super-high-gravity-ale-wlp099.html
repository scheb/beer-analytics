<p><em>Super High Gravity Ale (WLP099)</em> from White Labs is a distinctive ale yeast designed to effectively ferment in environments with high sugar concentration. It comes in a liquid form, enabling easier measurement and pitching into the brew. The yeast is characterized by an impressive attenuation of 85.0%, which refers to the percentage of sugar that the yeast will ferment out. The yeast also has a medium flocculation rate, meaning it forms moderate clumps and sediments after fermentation.</p>

<p>Its high alcohol tolerance makes it perfect for brewing <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">strong ales</a>, barley wines, and other high gravity beers. It operates ideally at fermentation temperatures of 64.4-69.8 °F (18.0-21.0 °C), ensuring an efficient fermentation process and production of desirable flavors. When used in brewing, <em>WLP099</em> yields beer styles such as <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/english-barleywine/">English Barleywine</a>, Russian <a href="/styles/american-porter-and-stout/imperial-stout/">Imperial Stout</a>, and <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/old-ale/">Old Ale</a>, with a flavor profile that supports rich, robust, and complex beers.
