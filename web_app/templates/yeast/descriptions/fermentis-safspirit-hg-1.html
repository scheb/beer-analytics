<p>The Fermentis <em>SafSpirit HG-1</em> is a dry ale yeast for brewing high-gravity beers. It has an attenuation of 80.0%, meaning that it can efficiently convert sugars into alcohol, resulting in higher ABV beers. This yeast has low flocculation, allowing the beer to retain more of its flavor and aroma compounds during fermentation. Its alcohol tolerance is very high, making it ideal for producing strong beers with a smooth finish. The optimal fermentation temperature range for this strain is 25.0-35.0 Â°C, providing brewers with a wide range of options to choose from when crafting their recipes.</p>
