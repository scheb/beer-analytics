<p>The <em>Dark Belgian Cask</em> (WLP4653) from The Yeast Bay is a liquid form yeast that is perfect for producing complex and unique beers. This strain contains Brettanomyces or bacteria and has a high alcohol tolerance. With its medium flocculation, it has an 82.5% attenuation, meaning it will produce a higher alcohol content than other yeasts. It ferments best at temperatures of 20-24Â°C and is great for barrel aging as well as long term storage.</p>
