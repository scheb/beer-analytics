<p>The Yeast Bay's <em>Hessian Pils</em> (WLP4035) is an ale yeast strain designed to produce a distinct malty profile, with a slightly sweet flavor. It comes in liquid form and has a medium flocculation rate, making it suitable for both bottle-conditioning and keg-conditioning. It has an attenuation of 73.5%, which is on the lower end of the scale, and its alcohol tolerance is low at just 6%. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain lies between 7.0-9.0 Â°C, allowing brewers to create a complex malt character without the risk of over-attenuation.</p>
