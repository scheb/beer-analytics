<p>The <em>Belgian Trappix</em> (B19) strain from Bulldog is a dry ale yeast that has a high flocculation and medium alcohol tolerance. It has an excellent attenuation of 78.0%, which helps to create beers with a nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. The ideal fermentation temperature for B19 is 18.0-25.0 Â°C, so brewers should strive to keep their fermenting beer in this range to achieve the best flavor and aroma profile from the yeast. This strain produces complex aromatic compounds that add depth and complexity to any beer it ferments, making it an ideal choice for Belgian style ales, <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">witbiers</a>, and <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>.</p>
