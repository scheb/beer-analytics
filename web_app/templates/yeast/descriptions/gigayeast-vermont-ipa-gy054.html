<p>GigaYeast's <em>Vermont IPA</em> (GY054) is a liquid ale yeast designed to give beers a clean and balanced flavor profile. It has an attenuation of 80.0%, a flocculation of medium-low, and an ideal fermentation temperature of 17.0-24.0 Â°C. This yeast is best used for creating New England style <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, as well as <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/ipa/">India Pale Ales</a>, and some DIPA styles. These beer styles will have a balanced malt and hop character due to this yeast's attenuation level, with subtle fruity esters that create a unique flavor profile.</p>
