<p>The <em>New World Saison</em> from Escarpment Labs is a liquid ale yeast that produces a highly attenuated beer, with an alcohol tolerance of 12.0%. Its flocculation properties are medium, allowing for a good balance between clarity and body. This yeast strain is best fermented at a temperature between 20.0-25.0 Â°C to bring out its full flavor potential. The result is a clean and crisp beer with notes of citrus, melon, and pepper spice.</p>
