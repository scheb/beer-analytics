<p>Wyeast's <em>Bavarian Lager</em> (2206) is a liquid lager yeast that has medium-high flocculation and an attenuation of 75.0%. It has an alcohol tolerance of up to 9.0%, and its ideal fermentation temperature is 8.0-14.0 °C. This yeast is perfect for brewing traditional German-style beers such as <a href="/styles/amber-malty-european-lager/maerzen/">Märzens</a>, Oktoberfests, Bocks, <a href="/styles/amber-bitter-european-beer/vienna-lager/">Vienna Lagers</a>, Dunkels, and Helles. This strain will produce a clean flavor profile with subtle notes of breadiness and fruitiness that compliments the malt character of the beer without overpowering it.</p>
