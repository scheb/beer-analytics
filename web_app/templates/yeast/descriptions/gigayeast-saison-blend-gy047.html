<p>GigaYeast's <em>Saison Blend</em> (GY047) is a high-performance liquid ale yeast that is perfect for creating <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a> and farmhouse ales. This strain has an attenuation of 81.5%, meaning that it will ferment out almost completely, leaving you with a dry and crisp finished beer. Its flocculation is low, so it will not leave much sediment at the bottom of your fermenter, making it easier to rack off or transfer. To get the optimal performance from this strain, the ideal fermentation temperature range should be between 18.0 - 27.0 Â°C.</p>
