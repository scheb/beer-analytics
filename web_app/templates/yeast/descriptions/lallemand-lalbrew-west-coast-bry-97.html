<p>LalBrew <em>West Coast</em> (BRY-97) is a dry ale yeast from Lallemand that has a high flocculation, high alcohol tolerance, and an ideal fermentation temperature of 15.0-22.0 Â°C. It produces beers with a clean flavor profile and enhanced hop character, making it ideal for classic American-style ales such as pale ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, and porters. The high attenuation rate of 75% helps create crisp beers with a dry finish, allowing the hop character to shine through. This yeast strain also produces subtle notes of fruit esters like apple or pear which make it well-suited for creating complex beer styles with layered flavors.</p>
