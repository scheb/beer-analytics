<p>White Labs' <em>Klassic Ale</em> (WLP033) is a liquid ale yeast designed for classic ales, such as <a href="/styles/british-bitter/strong-bitter/">English Pale Ale</a>, <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">Bitter</a>, and ESB. This yeast strain has great attenuation of 70%, meaning that it can produce high alcohol beers with little residual sweetness. It also has medium flocculation which will result in a clear beer with good body. Alcohol tolerance is also listed as medium, so it should be able to tolerate up to 6-7% ABV depending on the recipe. For best results the ideal fermentation temperature should be kept between 19.0-21.0 Â°C.</p>
