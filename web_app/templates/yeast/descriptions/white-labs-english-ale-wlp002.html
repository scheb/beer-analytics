<p><em>White Labs' English Ale Yeast</em>, formally known as WLP002, is a top-quality liquid ale yeast appreciated by brewers for its unique characteristics. This yeast has an attenuation rate of 66.5%, signifying its ability to convert sugar into alcohol and CO2, and it has a medium alcohol tolerance, making it a versatile choice for many beer styles. Notably, WLP002 is known for its very high flocculation, meaning it clumps together and settles rapidly after fermentation, making it easier to clear the beer. Its ideal fermentation temperature lies between 18.0-20.0°C (64.4-68.0°F), providing a nice balance of yeast activity and flavor development.</p>

With its ability to produce beers with a fruity, slightly sweet, and nutty profile, the WLP002 is cherished for its ability to bring out the best in these traditional styles.</p>
