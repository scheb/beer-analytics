<p>White Labs' <em>English Ale</em> (WLP002) is a liquid ale yeast that has very high flocculation and an attenuation rate of 66.5%. It has a medium alcohol tolerance, and should be fermented at temperatures ranging from 18.0 to 20.0 Â°C. This yeast strain is ideal for brewing classic British-style ales, including Pale Ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, ESBs, Barleywines and Stouts. It produces a smooth, malty profile with subtle fruit esters and hints of nutty flavor. The final product will have a full-bodied mouthfeel with a pleasant balance between malt sweetness and hop bitterness.</p>
