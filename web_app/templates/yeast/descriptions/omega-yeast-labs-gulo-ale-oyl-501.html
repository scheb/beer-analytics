<p><em>Gulo Ale</em> (OYL-501) from <a href="/hops/aroma/omega/">Omega</a> Yeast Labs is a liquid ale yeast that produces a clean, neutral flavor profile with medium flocculation. This strain has a high alcohol tolerance and an attenuation of 87.5%, making it suitable for fermenting higher gravity beers. The ideal fermentation temperature range for this strain of yeast is 20.0-25.0 Â°C, so it is best suited to ales that are fermented at warmer temperatures such as American Ales or <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian Ales</a>.</p>
