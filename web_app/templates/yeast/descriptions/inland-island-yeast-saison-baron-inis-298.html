<p>The <em>Saison : Baron</em> (INIS-298) liquid ale yeast from Inland Island Yeast is a great option for creating complex, flavorful beers. This yeast strain has an attenuation of 75.0%, meaning that most of the sugars in the wort are converted into alcohol during fermentation and produces a dry beer with medium body. Flocculation is medium, which means the yeast will settle out of suspension quickly once fermentation is finished. This strain also has a medium alcohol tolerance and ideal fermentation temperatures between 21.0-26.0Â°C so it can be used to create a wide range of beers with different flavor profiles.</p>
