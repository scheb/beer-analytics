<p>The <em>Scotch Whiskey</em> (WLP045) from White Labs is a liquid ale yeast that is well suited for making high alcohol whiskeys. It has an attenuation of 77.0%, a medium flocculation, and a high alcohol tolerance, allowing it to ferment up to 20% ABV. The ideal fermentation temperature range for this strain is 22.0-25.0 °C (71-77°F). This yeast will produce full bodied beers with a deep copper color and slight smokiness when used in whiskey production.</p>
