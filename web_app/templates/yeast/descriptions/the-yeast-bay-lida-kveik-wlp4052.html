<p><em>Lida Kveik</em> (WLP4052) from The Yeast Bay is a liquid ale yeast that is perfect for high ABV beers. It has a 79.0% attenuation and low flocculation, which allows the beer to retain sweetness and body. Additionally, it has a high alcohol tolerance, making it suitable for higher-alcohol beers. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is between 27.0-32.0 Â°C, so it's best used in warmer climates or when fermenting indoors with climate control.</p>
