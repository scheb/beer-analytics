It has an attenuation of 85.0%, making it ideal for fermenting high gravity beers with a dry finish. This strain ferments best at temperatures between 21.0-29.0 Â°C and is commonly used to brew Belgian styles such as <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, tripels, golden <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">strong ales</a>, dubbels and <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">witbiers</a>. Its flavor profile is fruity, spicy and earthy which accentuates the esters in these beer styles while giving them a balanced aroma and taste.</p>
