<p>Wyeast's <em>Scottish Ale</em> (1728) liquid ale yeast is a high flocculating strain with an attenuation of 71.0% and alcohol tolerance of up to 12.0%. It ferments best at temperatures between 13.0-24.0 Â°C, making it a great choice for brewing traditional <a href="/styles/scottish-ale/">Scottish ales</a> and similar styles such as <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/wee-heavy/">Scotch ales</a>, Wee Heavy, and Barley Wine. This yeast gives beers an intense flavor profile featuring maltiness, fruitiness, and slight smoky notes, with a smooth finish that balances the sweetness from the malts.</p>
