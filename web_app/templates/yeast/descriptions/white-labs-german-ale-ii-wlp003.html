<p>White Labs <em>German Ale II</em> (WLP003) is a versatile liquid ale yeast, perfect for creating classic German ales. It has an attenuation of 76.5%, meaning it will ferment out the sugars in the wort quickly and completely, resulting in a beer with a dry finish and good clarity. The flocculation is medium, providing enough sedimentation to give your beer good body but not too much that it becomes cloudy. Its alcohol tolerance is also medium, allowing you to brew beers up to 6-7% ABV. For best results, this yeast should be fermented at temperatures between 18 - 21Â°C.</p>
