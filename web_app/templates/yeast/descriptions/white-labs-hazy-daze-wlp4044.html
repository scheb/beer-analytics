<p>The <em>Hazy Daze</em> (WLP4044) liquid ale yeast from White Labs is perfect for brewing hazy <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> and other similar beers. This yeast strain has a low attenuation rate of 81%, meaning that a high amount of unfermentable sugars will remain in the beer, giving it a full body and smooth mouthfeel. It also has low flocculation, meaning that the yeast cells will suspend in the beer even after fermentation is complete. The alcohol tolerance is also low, making this yeast suitable for lower ABV beers. Ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 18-21Â°C, allowing brewers to easily control the flavor profile of their hazy <a href="/styles/ipa/">IPA</a>.</p>
