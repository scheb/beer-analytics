<p>The <em>Brettanomyces bruxellensis</em> (5112) of Wyeast is a liquid brett or bacteria strain that has an extremely high attenuation rate of 90.0%. It has a medium flocculation and an alcohol tolerance of 12.0%. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is between 16.0-24.0 Â°C, which makes it a great choice for producing complex and sour beers that are full bodied and flavourful. Its versatility also lends itself to being used in the production of Belgian style ales, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/lambic/">lambics</a>, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/gueuze/">gueuzes</a>, and other styles requiring the unique flavours produced by brett strains.</p>
