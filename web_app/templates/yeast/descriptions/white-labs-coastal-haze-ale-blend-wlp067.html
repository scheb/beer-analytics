<p><em>Coastal Haze Ale Blend</em> (WLP067) from White Labs is a liquid ale yeast with medium flocculation and a high alcohol tolerance. It is known for its high attenuation rate of 78% and is recommended for use in fermentation at temperatures between 18-26°C. This strain of yeast is ideal for brewing light-bodied beers such as ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, and <a href="/styles/pale-bitter-european-beer/koelsch/">Kölschs</a>. It produces a noticeable fruity ester profile with notes of melon, bubblegum, citrus, and pear. The resulting beer has a mild bitterness that balances the malt sweetness nicely.</p>
