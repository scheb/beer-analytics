<p>The Yeast Bay's <em>Midwestern Ale</em> (WLP4040) is a liquid ale yeast that offers excellent attenuation of 78.0% and medium flocculation. With a medium alcohol tolerance, it is ideal for fermenting beer styles with higher alcohol levels, such as <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a> and <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>. The fermentation temperature should be kept between 18.0-22.0 Â°C for optimal results, allowing the yeast to express its full range of flavors and aromas. This strain is well-suited for brewers looking to produce beers with classic American hop character and balanced malt profile.</p>
