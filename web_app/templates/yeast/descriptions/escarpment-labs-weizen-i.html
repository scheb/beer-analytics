<p>The <em>Weizen I</em> liquid ale yeast from Escarpment Labs is a great choice for creating a classic <a href="/styles/german-wheat-beer/">German wheat beer</a>. It features low flocculation which results in a cloudy beer and it has a moderate to high attenuation of 72.5%. This yeast can tolerate medium levels of alcohol and is best used at temperatures between 18-24Â°C. This strain will impart some fruity esters into your brew, such as banana and clove, as well as some light bubble gum flavors.</p>
