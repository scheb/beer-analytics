<p><em>Moravian Vale</em> (CL010) is a liquid lager yeast strain from Crescat Labs. This strain has a high flocculation, allowing it to clump together and settle out of suspension quickly, making it easier to separate from the beer. It has an attenuation of 75%, meaning that it will ferment the sugar in the wort efficiently. Its alcohol tolerance is 12%, so it can handle a stronger beer without any problems. Finally, its ideal fermentation temperature range is 8-12Â°C, allowing brewers to make sure their beer ferments at the right temperature for maximum flavor and clarity.</p>
