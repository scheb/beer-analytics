<p>Mangrove Jack's <em>Workhorse Beer</em> (M10) is a dry ale yeast that produces a strong, full-bodied flavor. With an attenuation rate of 78%, this yeast produces a light-colored beer with plenty of body and flavor. It has a medium flocculation rate, meaning it settles out of suspension well and produces a clear beer with plenty of carbonation. The ideal fermentation temperature for this yeast is 15.0-20.0Â°C, producing the best balance between ester formation and attenuation rates for optimal flavors and aromas in your finished beer.</p>
