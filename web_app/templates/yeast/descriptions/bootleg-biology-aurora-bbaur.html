<p>The <em>Aurora</em> (BBAUR) liquid ale yeast by Bootleg Biology is a high-performance strain with excellent fermentation characteristics. It has an 81.0% attenuation rate, meaning it will convert the majority of sugars into alcohol, and a medium flocculation rate, which results in clear beer with low sediment. This yeast can tolerate up to 13% ABV and ferments best between 24-37Â°C, allowing brewers to work with a wide range of temperatures for optimal flavour profile. <em>Aurora</em> (BBAUR) is an ideal choice for all types of ale styles, from light ales to dark stouts and everything in between.</p>
