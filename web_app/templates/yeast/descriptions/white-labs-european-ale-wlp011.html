<p>White Labs <em>European Ale</em> (WLP011) is a liquid ale yeast type that is perfect for producing balanced beers with a wide range of flavor profiles. This yeast has an attenuation of 67.5%, meaning it will ferment most of the sugars in your beer to create a dry finish, and its flocculation is considered medium. The alcohol tolerance for this strain is medium, allowing you to produce beers up to 7-9% ABV without any off-flavors. For optimum results, White Labs recommends fermenting this yeast between 18.0 and 21.0 Â°C; however, it can still produce good results even if fermentation temperatures are slightly higher or lower than this range.</p>
