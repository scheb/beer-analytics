<p>GigaYeast's <em>Czech Pilsner</em> (GY002) is a liquid lager yeast with a medium-high flocculation rate. It has an attenuation of 77.0%, meaning it ferments the sugars in wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide efficiently, resulting in a well-rounded flavor profile that is typical of many European pilsners. The ideal fermentation temperature for GY002 is between 9.0 and 13.0 Â°C, making it suitable for brewing cool-fermented lagers at home and achieving great results.</p>
