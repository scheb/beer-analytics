<p>The <em>British Ale III</em> (A-32) liquid yeast from BSI is a high flocculation ale yeast that can tolerate medium levels of alcohol. It has an attenuation rate of 69.0%, and should be fermented within the ideal temperature range of 16.0-22.0Â°C for best results. This strain is perfect for producing true English style ales with a balanced flavor profile, and will produce beers with a malty sweetness and subtle fruity undertones.</p>
