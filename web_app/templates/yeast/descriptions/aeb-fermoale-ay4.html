<p>The <em>Fermoale AY4</em> yeast from AEB is a dry ale yeast that has a high flocculation and medium alcohol tolerance. It produces a highly attenuated beer, with an attenuation of up to 75%. This yeast works best in the ideal fermentation temperature range of 17.0-25.0Â°C, making it suitable for most fermentation processes. It is also very tolerant of oxygen levels and can produce good results even when oxygen levels are low.</p>
