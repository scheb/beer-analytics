<p>Bulldog's <em>English Ale</em> (B4) is a dry ale yeast with high flocculation and medium alcohol tolerance. It has an attenuation of 67.0%, making it a great option for creating a full-bodied beer. This yeast is best fermented at 16.0-21.0 Â°C, allowing for complex esters to develop in the finished beer without becoming overly fruity. This yeast is perfect for producing traditional British ales such as <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitters</a>, porters, and milds.</p>
