<p>The <em>Monastic</em> (B63) strain of Imperial Yeast is a liquid ale yeast with medium-low flocculation. It has an attenuation of 74.0%, meaning it can ferment up to 74% of the sugars in a wort, resulting in higher alcohol content. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 20.0-26.0 °C (68-78°F). This yeast produces light fruit esters and slight spicy phenolics that are well balanced, making it great for Belgian-style ales and Trappist beers.</p>
