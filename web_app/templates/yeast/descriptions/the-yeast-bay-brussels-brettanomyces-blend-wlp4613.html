<p>The Yeast Bay's <em>Brussels Brettanomyces Blend</em> (WLP4613) is a liquid strain of brett and bacteria that produces high levels of acidity and funkiness. It has an attenuation of 80%, a medium flocculation, a high alcohol tolerance, and an ideal fermentation temperature range of 21-27Â°C. This blend complements malt complexity in Belgian style beers, with good expression of hop bitterness and character. It can also be used to produce sour beers in conjunction with other yeast strains or bacteria.</p>
