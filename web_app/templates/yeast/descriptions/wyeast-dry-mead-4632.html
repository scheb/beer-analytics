<p>The <em>Dry Mead</em> (4632) liquid wine and cider yeast from Wyeast is a special strain designed for mead making. It has an attenuation of 95.0% and a low flocculation, meaning it will not settle out quickly and will remain suspended in the fermentation medium. It has an alcohol tolerance of 18.0%, so it can be used to make high-alcohol meads, and it ferments best at temperatures between 13.0-24.0 Â°C. This is a great choice for making traditional mead styles like cyser or melomel as well as sweeter, more modern meads like fruit or spice meads.</p>
