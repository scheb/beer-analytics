<p>White Labs' <em>Zurich Lager</em> (WLP885) is a liquid lager yeast strain that provides a malty and clean finish. With an attenuation of 75.0%, it ferments well at temperatures between 10.0-13.0Â°C, making it a great choice for brewing lower-alcohol beers. It has medium flocculation and alcohol tolerance, making it suitable for most lager styles. The yeast strain produces a subtle fruitiness in the beer with low ester production and can be used for both primary and secondary fermentation in many styles of lagers.</p>
