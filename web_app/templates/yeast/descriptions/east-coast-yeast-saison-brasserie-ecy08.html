<p><em>Saison Brasserie</em> (ECY08) is a liquid ale yeast from East Coast Yeast. It has an attenuation of 80.0%, meaning it will convert most of the fermentable sugars in your wort into alcohol, resulting in a dry beer. Its flocculation rate is medium, so you can expect it to produce a good amount of sediment at the end of fermentation. This yeast strain works best between 24.0-29.0 Â°C, making it ideal for warmer brewing environments.</p>
