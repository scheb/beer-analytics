<p>Wheat yeasts, often employed in the brewing of wheat beers, exhibit several distinct characteristics compared to other types of yeasts used in brewing. These yeasts typically produce beer with a higher carbonation level, a full-bodied mouthfeel, and a characteristically hazy appearance due to the yeast and protein content. Flavor-wise, they are known for contributing unique taste notes to the beer, such as banana, bubblegum, apple, clove, and other spicy or fruity esters and phenols. This is a stark contrast to most <a href="{% url "yeast_type" "ale" %}">ale</a> or <a href="{% url "yeast_type" "lager" %}">lager yeasts</a>, which typically produce cleaner tasting beers with minimal esters and phenols. Wheat yeasts also have the ability to metabolize more complex sugars, allowing for a dry finish despite the rich flavors.</p>

<p>Wheat yeasts are most commonly used in beer styles such as <a href="/styles/german-wheat-beer/weissbier/">Weissbier</a>, Hefeweizen, Dunkelweizen, and <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">Witbier</a>, which are known for their heavy use of wheat malt. Each of these styles exhibits the distinctive features provided by wheat yeasts - from the cloudiness and full body to the complex, fruity, and spicy flavors. Brewers who aim to develop these traditional, characteristic wheat beer traits generally prefer wheat yeasts over other yeasts. The specific strain of wheat yeast used can further affect the balance of flavors, providing an additional layer of complexity to the brewing process.</p>
