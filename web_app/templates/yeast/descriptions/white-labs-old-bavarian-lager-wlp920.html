<p>White Labs <em>Old Bavarian Lager</em> (WLP920) is a liquid lager yeast ideal for producing traditional German lagers. This lager yeast has an attenuation of 69.5%, meaning that it is able to ferment most of the available sugars in the wort, resulting in a dryer beer with higher alcohol content. It also has medium flocculation, meaning that it will drop out of suspension quickly after fermentation is complete and produce clearer beers with less sediment. The alcohol tolerance for this strain is also medium, making it suitable for beers up to 5-6% ABV. Lastly, this strain ferments best at temperatures between 10.0-13.0 °C (50-55°F), which should be maintained throughout fermentation for best results.</p>
