<p>The <em>Superyeast High Gravity Ale</em> (SY042) from Bio4 is a liquid ale yeast designed for high-gravity fermentation. With an attenuation of 80%, the yeast produces full-bodied beers with a medium flocculation rate and a high alcohol tolerance. The optimal fermentation temperature range is 18.0 to 22.0Â°C, making it ideal for fermenting higher-alcohol ales in warmer temperatures. SY042 is a great choice for brewers looking to craft complex, flavorful high gravity brews.</p>
