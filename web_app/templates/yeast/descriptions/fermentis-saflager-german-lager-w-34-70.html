<p>Saflager <em>German Lager</em> (W-34/70) from Fermentis is a dry lager yeast with high flocculation and an alcohol tolerance of up to 10.5%. This yeast strain performs best under temperatures ranging from 9.0 to 22.0 °C and offers an attenuation of 83.0%. It is well suited for brewing traditional German lagers, such as Helles, Pilsner, or <a href="/styles/amber-malty-european-lager/maerzen/">Märzen</a>, as it produces a clean flavor profile with subtle hop notes and mild aromatics. The delicate malt character is balanced by subtle fruit esters that give the beer complexity without overpowering it.</p>
