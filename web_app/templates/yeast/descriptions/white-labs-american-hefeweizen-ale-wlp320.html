<p>White Labs' <em>American Hefeweizen Ale</em> (WLP320) is a liquid ale yeast that comes with low flocculation and medium alcohol tolerance. It ferments best at temperatures between 18.0-21.0 Â°C, with an attenuation of 72.5%. This yeast strain is excellent for brewing traditional German-style wheat beers, such as Hefeweizens and Dunkelweizens. It produces classic banana and clove flavors along with notes of citrus and other fruit esters, giving the beer a refreshing sweetness that balances out the malt body.</p>
