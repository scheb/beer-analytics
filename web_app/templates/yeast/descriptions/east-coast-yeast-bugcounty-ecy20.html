<p><em>BugCounty</em> (ECY20) is an ale yeast strain developed by East Coast Yeast. It's a liquid form and comes with a high attenuation level of 80%, meaning it will ferment most of the sugars in your wort, leaving behind a drier beer. This strain works best at temperatures between 16-23Â°C, so you'll need to make sure to provide a stable temperature during fermentation if you want to get the best possible results. With its great attenuation and temperature range, <em>BugCounty</em> (ECY20) is perfect for brewers of all levels looking for an easy-to-use and reliable ale yeast strain.</p>
