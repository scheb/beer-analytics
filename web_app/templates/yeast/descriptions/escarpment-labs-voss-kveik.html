<p>The <em>Voss Kveik</em> from Escarpment Labs is a liquid ale yeast strain that is perfect for brewers looking to create beers with high alcohol content. This yeast has an impressive attenuation of 72.5%, meaning it can ferment the majority of the sugars present in the wort, leaving behind a clean and dry beer. Additionally, its flocculation is high and it has a very high tolerance for alcohol, making it ideal for producing beer with high ABV levels. The ideal fermentation temperature range for this strain of yeast is 25.0-42.0 Â°C, allowing brewers to produce beers with a wide variety of flavor profiles depending on the temperature they choose to ferment at.</p>
