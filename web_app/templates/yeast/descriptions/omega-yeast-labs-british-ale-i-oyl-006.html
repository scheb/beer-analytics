<p>The <em>British Ale I</em> (OYL-006) from <a href="/hops/aroma/omega/">Omega</a> Yeast Labs is a liquid ale yeast that is perfect for creating classic British ales. This easy-to-use yeast has an attenuation of 75.0%, a medium-high flocculation, and an alcohol tolerance of 10.0%. It ferments best at temperatures between 18.0 and 22.0 Â°C, making it ideal for brewing traditional English beers like pale ales and <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitters</a>. The combination of its high attenuation and alcohol tolerance make it a great choice for producing full-bodied ales with complex flavours and aromas.</p>
