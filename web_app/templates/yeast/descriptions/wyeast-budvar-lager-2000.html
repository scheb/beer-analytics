<p>The <em>Budvar Lager</em> (2000) from Wyeast is a liquid lager yeast that produces a crisp and clean lager. With an attenuation of 73%, it is highly fermentable and flocculates medium-high, resulting in a well-balanced beer with no residual sweetness. It has a high alcohol tolerance of 9%, allowing for the development of complex flavors even when brewing high-gravity beers. For best results, it should be fermented at temperatures between 9-13°C. Whether you’re brewing a Pilsner or <a href="/styles/amber-bitter-european-beer/vienna-lager/">Vienna Lager</a>, this yeast will result in excellent clarity and great drinkability every time.</p>
