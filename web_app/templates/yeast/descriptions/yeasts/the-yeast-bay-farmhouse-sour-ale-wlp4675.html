<p>The Yeast Bay's <em>Farmhouse Sour Ale</em> (WLP4675) is a liquid form of yeast designed to produce a brett or bacteria fermenting sour beer. It has an attenuation level of 90.0%, meaning that it will use up much of the available sugars in the wort for fermentation. This yeast has medium flocculation, and a low alcohol tolerance. It should be fermented at temperatures between 21-26Â°C for optimal flavor profiles.</p>
