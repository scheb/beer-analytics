<p>GigaYeast's <em>Scourmont Abbey Ale</em> (GY014) is a liquid ale yeast that is perfect for a variety of Belgian-style ales. It has an attenuation of 80.0%, and low flocculation, resulting in beer with complex esters and phenols. It ferments best in temperatures between 18.0 to 27.0 Â°C, making it ideal for many Belgian-style beers such as Dubbels, Tripels, and <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>. With its high attenuation rate, it produces a beer with a full body and plenty of complex flavors.</p>
