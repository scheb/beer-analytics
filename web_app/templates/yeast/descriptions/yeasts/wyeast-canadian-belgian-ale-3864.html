<p>The Wyeast 3864 <em>Canadian/Belgian Ale</em> is a liquid ale yeast ideal for producing fruity and spicy Belgian-style ales. It has a high attenuation rate of 77.0%, meaning it will fully ferment the wort and create a dry beer with higher alcohol content. This yeast also has medium flocculation, which helps contribute to its unique flavor profile by leaving some of the malt sugars in the beer. The alcohol tolerance is 12.0%, allowing brewers to make higher alcohol beers if desired. For best results, this yeast should be fermented at temperatures between 18.0 - 27.0 Â°C, allowing brewers to create complex yet balanced Belgian-style ales with beautiful aromas and flavors.</p>
