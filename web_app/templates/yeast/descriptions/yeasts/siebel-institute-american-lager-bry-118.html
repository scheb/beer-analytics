<p>The <em>American Lager</em> (BRY 118) yeast from the Siebel Institute is a liquid lager yeast. It has a high flocculation, meaning it will settle quickly at the bottom of the fermenter. This particular strain is highly attenuative and can ferment up to 72%. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is between 20 to 22Â°C. This lager yeast produces a clean and crisp flavor profile with slight malt character, making it ideal for light lagers like Budweiser or Coors.</p>
