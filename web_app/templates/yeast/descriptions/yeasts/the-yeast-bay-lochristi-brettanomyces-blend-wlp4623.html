<p>The Yeast Bay's <em>Lochristi Brettanomyces Blend</em> (WLP4623) is a liquid, brett and bacteria blend yeast with an attenuation of 80.0%, a medium flocculation, low alcohol tolerance and ideal fermentation temperature of 21.0-27.0 Â°C. This blend is perfect for producing tart, funky flavors in beers and can be used in a wide range of beer styles such as <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/lambic/">lambics</a>, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/gueuze/">gueuzes</a> and fruited sours. Its low alcohol tolerance allows brewers to produce these styles without the worry of over-attenuating or producing too much heat during fermentation. The unique blend of yeasts gives this blend complexity that can add layers of flavor to any beer style it is used in.</p>
