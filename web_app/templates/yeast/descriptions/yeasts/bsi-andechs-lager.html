<p>The <em>Andechs Lager</em> from BSI is a liquid lager yeast strain with medium flocculation and alcohol tolerance. With an attenuation of 73.0%, this yeast produces full-bodied beers with good body and mouthfeel. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 10.0-12.0 Â°C, making it suitable for producing crisp lagers in cooler temperatures. This strain is perfect for producing traditional European-style lagers such as Pilsners, Helles, and <a href="/styles/amber-bitter-european-beer/vienna-lager/">Vienna Lagers</a>.</p>
