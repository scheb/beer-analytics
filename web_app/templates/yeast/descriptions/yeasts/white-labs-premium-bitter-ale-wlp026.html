<p>White Labs <em>Premium <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">Bitter</a> Ale</em> (WLP026) is a liquid ale yeast that is ideal for producing British-style bitter ales. The attenuation of this strain is 72.5%, which contributes to the final beer's dryness and complexity. The flocculation of WLP026 is medium, creating a well-balanced beer with good clarity. This strain can tolerate medium levels of alcohol, making it suitable for brewing higher strength beers such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">English IPA</a> or Barleywine styles. Fermentation should occur at temperatures between 19 and 16 Â°C for optimal results.</p>
