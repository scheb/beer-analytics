<p>The <em>Andechs Weizen</em> from BSI is a liquid ale yeast that can be used to produce traditional Bavarian-style wheat beers. It has a low flocculation rate and an attenuation of 74.0%, meaning it produces a beer with a full body and high alcohol content. The alcohol tolerance is medium, so it can handle higher alcohol concentrations without sacrificing flavor. For best results, fermentation should occur between 18.0-21.0 Â°C, allowing for the fullest expression of its intense banana and clove aromas and flavors.</p>
