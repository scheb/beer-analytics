<p>The <em>Trappist Ale II</em> (RVA 202) from RVA Yeast Labs is a liquid ale yeast designed to ferment high alcohol beers. With an attenuation rating of 77.5%, this yeast allows for a wide range of beer styles to be crafted, ranging from light and crisp to full-bodied and complex. It has a medium flocculation rate, meaning it will settle well during fermentation, leaving behind minimal sediment. This yeast also features a high alcohol tolerance, allowing for higher ABV beers without risking off flavors or reduced attenuation. For best results, it is recommended that the fermentation occur between 18.0-22.0Â°C for optimal flavor development.</p>
