<p>The <em>Suburban Brett</em> (W15) from Imperial Yeast is a liquid form of brettanomyces or bacteria, ideal for creating unique and complex flavors. It has an attenuation of 77.5%, meaning that it ferments quickly and efficiently, while its low flocculation ensures that these flavors are retained in the finished beer. This strain is best used at temperatures between 18-23Â°C for optimal results.</p>
