<p>The <em>Belgian Schelde</em> (3655) from Wyeast is a liquid ale yeast that produces a classic Belgian-style beer. It has an attenuation of 75.0%, meaning that it has high alcohol tolerance of up to 11.0%. The flocculation is medium, and it ferments best in temperatures of 17.0-23.0 Â°C. This strain is well suited for producing a variety of Belgian styles, including golden ales, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, and white beers. It will leave behind subtle esters and phenolics that give the beer a unique complexity and depth of flavor.</p>
