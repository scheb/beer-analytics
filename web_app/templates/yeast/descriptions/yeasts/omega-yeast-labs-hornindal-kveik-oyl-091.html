<p><em>Hornindal Kveik</em> (OYL-091) from <a href="/hops/aroma/omega/">Omega</a> Yeast Labs is a liquid ale yeast that produces high flocculation and a 79.0% attenuation rate. It has an alcohol tolerance of 12.0%, and its ideal fermentation temperature range is 21.0-35.0 Â°C, making it well suited for a variety of beer styles. This strain produces lightly balanced fruity esters giving off flavors of orange and tangerine with subtle notes of pineapple. It's great for producing Pale Ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>, Farmhouse Ales, Sours, and other Belgian inspired beers. It also works well in combination with other yeast strains to create complex flavor profiles in hybrid beers such as fruited sour ales or <a href="/styles/trappist-ale/belgian-dubbel/">Belgian Dubbels</a>.</p>
