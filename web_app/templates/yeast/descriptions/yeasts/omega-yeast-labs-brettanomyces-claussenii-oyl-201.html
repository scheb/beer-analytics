<p>Omega Yeast Labs' <em>Brettanomyces Claussenii</em> (OYL-201) is a liquid yeast strain of the brett/bacteria family. It has a low flocculation, meaning that it won't form large clumps during fermentation. Its attenuation of 48.0% and alcohol tolerance up to 10.0%, make it ideal for producing high ABV beers. This strain is best suited to fermenting at temperatures between 20.0-29.0Â°C and gives off fruity and acidic aromas with hints of spice and funk in the final product.</p>
