<p>The <em>Lactobacillus Blend</em> (OYL-605) from <a href="/hops/aroma/omega/">Omega</a> Yeast Labs is a liquid form of bacteria, specifically a blend of three different lactobacillus strains. This strain has an alcohol tolerance of up to 12.0%, with an ideal fermentation temperature between 20.0 and 35.0 Â°C, making it suitable for many beer styles. The flavor profile created by this yeast is typically tart, acidic and refreshing, with notes of lemon, stone fruit and hay depending on the style of beer being brewed. It's perfect for brewing sour beers such as <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/berliner-weisse/">Berliner Weisse</a> or <a href="/styles/historical-beer/gose/">Gose</a> as well as wild ales like <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/lambic/">Lambic</a> or <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/flanders-red-ale/">Flanders Red Ale</a>.</p>
