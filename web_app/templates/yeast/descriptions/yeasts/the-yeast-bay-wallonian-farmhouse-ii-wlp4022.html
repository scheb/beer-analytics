<p>The <em>Wallonian Farmhouse II</em> (WLP4022) liquid ale yeast from The Yeast Bay is an excellent choice for high-alcohol beers. This yeast strain's high alcohol tolerance allows for fermentation up to 16% ABV, and its medium flocculation helps create a clear beer with good body and flavor. It has an attenuation of 81%, producing dry beers with a noticeable ester character. Ideal fermentation temperature ranges from 20-27°C and this strain works best in traditional farmhouse ales such as <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a> and bières de garde.</p>
