<p>The <em>BB 3</em> from Mainiacal Yeast Labs is a liquid ale yeast that is perfect for brewers looking for a reliable and consistent fermentation. This yeast has a medium attenuation of 76.0%, meaning it will ferment the sugars in your wort to create a full-bodied beer with a rich flavor profile. Flocculation is also medium, so you can expect some sedimentation but not an overly cloudy beer. The alcohol tolerance is also medium, so you don’t need to worry about over-attenuation or stuck fermentation. It ferments best at temperatures between 20.0-26°C, making it suitable for most lager styles as well as ales.</p>
