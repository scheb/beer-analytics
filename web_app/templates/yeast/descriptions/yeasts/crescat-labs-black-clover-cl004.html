<p>The <em>Black Clover</em> (CL004) from Crescat Labs is a liquid ale yeast that has very high flocculation. It has an attenuation of 73.0% and can tolerate alcohol up to 12.0%, making it suitable for higher-gravity beers such as barleywines, <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">strong ales</a>, and <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>. This strain also ferments best at temperatures between 16.0-22.0 Â°C, so it's perfect for producing well-balanced beers with plenty of esters and phenols.</p>
