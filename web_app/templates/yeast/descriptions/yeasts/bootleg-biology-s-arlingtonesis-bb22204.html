<p><em>S. Arlingtonesis</em> (BB22204) is a liquid ale yeast produced by Bootleg Biology. It has an attenuation of 85.0%, a medium flocculation, and a medium alcohol tolerance. It ferments best at temperatures between 16 and 24 degrees Celsius, making it an ideal choice for creating ales with balanced flavor profiles in a broad range of temperatures. Additionally, its medium flocculation makes it easier to separate from the beer after fermentation is complete, resulting in less sediment and reduced chill haze.</p>
