<p>The <em>British Cask</em> (OYL-038) from <a href="/hops/aroma/omega/">Omega</a> Yeast Labs is a liquid ale yeast suitable for a variety of beer styles. It has an impressive attenuation of 75.5%, a high flocculation, and a medium alcohol tolerance. The ideal fermentation temperature range for this strain is between 17.0-22.0 Â°C, giving brewers enough flexibility to produce the desired beer characteristics in their finished product. This yeast strain can be used to create classic English ales with notes of biscuit and toast, as well as fruity esters when fermented at the higher end of its temperature range.</p>
