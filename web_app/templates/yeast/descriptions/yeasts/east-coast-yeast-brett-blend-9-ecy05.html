<p>The <em>Brett Blend #9</em> (ECY05) from East Coast Yeast is a liquid form of brettanomyces and bacteria blend that is perfectly suited for producing many styles of beer. This blend has an attenuation of 75.0% and ideally ferments at a temperature range of 21.0-21.0 Â°C, making it suitable for both lagers and ales. It will produce a unique flavor profile in the beer due to its blend of wild yeast, lending a complexity that can't be achieved with traditional brewer's yeast alone.</p>
