<p>The <em>Saison Single</em> (ECY14) liquid ale yeast from East Coast Yeast is perfect for producing saison-style beers. This yeast has a high attenuation of 77.0%, which results in dry and complex flavors. The flocculation is medium, making it ideal for hazy, low <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> beers with a high carbonation level. It ferments best at temperatures between 24.0-28.0 Â°C, so you can expect to get the best flavor if you keep your fermentation chamber at the right temperature.</p>
