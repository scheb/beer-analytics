<p><em>Berliner Blend</em> (BBXBRLN) from Bootleg Biology is a liquid form of yeast that is composed of both Brett and bacteria. Its low attenuation rate of 98.0% allows for a very dry beer with high amounts of acidity. This strain also has a low flocculation rating, which results in long fermentation times while still allowing clarity in the finished beer. It has a low alcohol tolerance and should be fermented at temperatures between 18-24Â°C for best results.</p>
