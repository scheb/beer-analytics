<p>The <em>Belgian Abbaye</em> (ECY09) from East Coast Yeast is a liquid ale yeast strain that is perfect for brewing Belgian-style ales. It offers a high attenuation of up to 75% and has good flocculation properties, making it an ideal choice for top-fermented beers. The optimal fermentation temperature lies between 19.0 and 22.0 Â°C, allowing brewers to craft classic Belgian styles with the desired flavor profile without spending too much time controlling the temperature of their fermentation tanks.</p>
