<p>The <em>Bavarian Weizen Ale</em> (BRY 235) from the Siebel Institute is a liquid ale yeast strain with a high flocculation profile and an attenuation of 73.0%. It is ideal for brewing light wheat beers, with the optimal fermentation temperature at 10.0-14.0Â°C. The strain provides a subtle fruitiness and flavor complexity, while also producing classic phenols, esters, and banana notes that are characteristic of Bavarian wheat beers. It has good sedimentation qualities, resulting in clear, bright beers with low haze levels. BRY 235 is an excellent choice for traditional Bavarian wheat beer styles such as Hefeweizen or Kristalweizen.</p>
