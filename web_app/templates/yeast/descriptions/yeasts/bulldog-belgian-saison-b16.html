<p>The <em>Belgian Saison</em> (B16) from Bulldog is a dry ale yeast with medium flocculation and high alcohol tolerance. It has an attenuation of 85.0% and is best fermented at a temperature of 18.0-30.0Â°C. This yeast strain produces esters, which gives the beer fruity aromas, as well as spicy phenols that add complexity to the flavor profile. This yeast works particularly well for creating traditional <em>Belgian Saison</em> beers, but can also be used in other styles such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> and pale ales.</p>
