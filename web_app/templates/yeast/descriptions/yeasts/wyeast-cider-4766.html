<p>Wyeast's <em>Cider</em> (4766) is a liquid wine and cider yeast that is designed to produce crisp, dry ciders. It has a high attenuation of 85%, meaning it will ferment the sugars in your cider completely for a dry finish. This strain also has low flocculation, which helps keep the flavors of your cider bright and fruity instead of muddled. Additionally, it has an alcohol tolerance of 12%, so you can be sure that your cider won't become over-alcoholic even with a higher starting gravity. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 18-21Â°C, so you can be sure that your yeast will remain active throughout the fermentation process.</p>
