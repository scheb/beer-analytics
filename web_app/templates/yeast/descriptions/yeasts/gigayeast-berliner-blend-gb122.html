<p>The <em>Berliner Blend</em> (GB122) from GigaYeast is a liquid form of yeast blend which contains Brettanomyces and bacteria. This strain is ideal for creating traditional Berliner Weisse-style beers, with an attenuation of 89.0%. The ideal fermentation temperature for this blend is 21.0-27.0 Â°C, allowing brewers to create a light-bodied beer with subtle tartness. The Brettanomyces component of the blend will contribute fruity esters and slight funk, while the lactic acid producing bacteria will add sourness and complexity to the final beer.</p>
