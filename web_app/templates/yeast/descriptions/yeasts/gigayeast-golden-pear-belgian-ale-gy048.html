<p>The GigaYeast <em>Golden Pear Belgian Ale</em> (GY048) is a liquid ale yeast strain that produces remarkably high attenuation levels of up to 84.0%. This strain also has low flocculation properties and ideal fermentation temperatures between 18.0-27.0 Â°C, making it great for producing light, crisp and highly drinkable beers. For best results, it should be used in combination with other Belgian-style yeast strains to create complex flavors and aromas.</p>
