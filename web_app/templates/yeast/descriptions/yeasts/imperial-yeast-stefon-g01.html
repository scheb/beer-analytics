<p><em>Stefon</em> (G01) is a liquid ale yeast from Imperial Yeast. It has a 73.0% attenuation, which means it is able to convert most of the fermentable sugars into alcohol. This yeast also has low flocculation, meaning it will stay suspended in your beer for longer and result in a fuller body and better mouthfeel. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain ranges from 17.0-23.0 Â°C, making it an excellent choice for ales of all styles and strengths.</p>
