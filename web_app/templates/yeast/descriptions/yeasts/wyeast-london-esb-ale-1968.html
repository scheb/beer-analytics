<p><em>The London ESB Ale (1968)</em> from Wyeast is a unique ale yeast that comes in liquid form, making it ideal for home brewers looking for a strain that is easy to use. This yeast is famous for its very high flocculation characteristics and a fairly high alcohol tolerance of 10.0%, allowing it to thrive in stronger, more robust brews. It presents an attenuation of 69.0%, which denotes its ability to ferment available sugars into alcohol and CO2. Ideally, this yeast should be fermented at temperatures ranging between 64.4-71.6°F (18.0-22.0°C), a range that supports the optimal activity and health of the yeast cells.</p>
