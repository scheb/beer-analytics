<p>The <em>Fermoale</em> of AEB is a dry ale yeast with a high flocculation. It has an attenuation of 72.5%, meaning that it will create beers with a low to medium body and strength. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 18.0-25.0 Â°C, making it suitable for a wide range of beer styles, including ales, lagers, and Belgian styles. This yeast strain is great for creating beers with a clean finish and subtle esters that do not overpower the other flavors in the beer.</p>
