<p>GigaYeast's <em>Sour Cherry Funk</em> (GB150) is a liquid yeast strain that consists of a combination of Brett and bacteria. This yeast strain has a low flocculation, meaning it will remain suspended in the beer for longer. It has an attenuation of 65%, making it ideal for creating sour beers with complex flavor profiles. The alcohol tolerance is medium, so it can be used to craft higher ABV beers without compromising the flavor profile. Lastly, the ideal fermentation temperature range is 20-27Â°C - any lower and you may not get the full flavor potential out of this unique strain.</p>
