<p><em>Lærdal</em> is a liquid ale yeast strain from Mainiacal Yeast Labs. It has excellent attenuation of 80% and low flocculation, making it suitable for a wide range of ales. Despite its low alcohol tolerance, <em>Lærdal</em> can be used to ferment ales at temperatures ranging between 27-41°C, making it a great choice for brewing in warmer climates. The low alcohol tolerance also means that it should be monitored carefully during fermentation so as not to produce too much alcohol.</p>
