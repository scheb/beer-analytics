<p>The <em>German Kölsch</em> (BRY 401) from Siebel Institute is a liquid ale yeast that produces a crisp, slightly fruity beer. This yeast has an attenuation of 72.0% and flocculation of low, meaning it will ferment quickly and the resulting beer will be highly carbonated with good clarity. Ideal fermentation temperatures for this strain are 13.0-15.0 °C, so it should be fermented in cooler conditions for maximum flavor development. The end result will be a light, refreshing beer with subtle fruit notes and plenty of effervescence.</p>
