<p>The Yeast Bay's <em>TYB House Sour Blend</em> is a liquid form blend of Brettanomyces and bacteria. Its high attenuation rate of 92.5% allows for a great level of sourness in the final product, while its low flocculation ensures that the yeast remains suspended in the mixture. Its high alcohol tolerance makes it an ideal choice for producing stronger beers, and its ideal fermentation temperature range of 20-26Â°C ensures that the desired level of sourness will be achieved. The <em>TYB House Sour Blend</em> is perfect for creating unique and complex sour ales with delightful aromas and flavors.</p>
