<p>The Crossmyloof Brew <em>Monk</em> is a dry ale yeast used in many beer styles. Its attenuation rate of 69.0% and its medium flocculation make it an ideal choice for a variety of beers, including ales and lagers. The medium alcohol tolerance means that this yeast can be used to ferment up to 10-12% ABV beers. The ideal fermentation temperature for this yeast is 15.0-20.0 Â°C, so brewers will want to keep the fermentation temperatures within this range in order to obtain the best results from their beer.</p>
