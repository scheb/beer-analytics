<p>The <em>Oktoberfest</em> (OYL-107) liquid lager yeast from <a href="/hops/aroma/omega/">Omega</a> Yeast Labs is a great choice for malty and complex beer styles. This yeast has a high attenuation of 75%, resulting in a dry, crisp finish. Its flocculation is medium-high, meaning that it will form clumps of sediment in the bottle which can be filtered out if desired. With an alcohol tolerance of 9.0%, this yeast can handle higher ABV beers and still perform well. The ideal fermentation temperature range is 8.0–14.0 °C (46–57 °F), making it a versatile strain to use in any brewing environment.</p>
