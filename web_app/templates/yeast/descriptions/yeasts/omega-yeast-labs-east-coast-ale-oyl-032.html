This strain has an attenuation of 73.0%, allowing for the conversion of fermentable sugars into alcohol and CO2, and can handle up to 10.0% ABV in terms of alcohol tolerance. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 20.0-23.0 Â°C, making it well suited for producing classic American ales such as pale ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, and <a href="/styles/brown-british-beer/british-brown-ale/">brown ales</a>.</p>
