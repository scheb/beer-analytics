<p>The <em>Munich Helles</em> (WLP860) from White Labs is a liquid lager yeast with medium flocculation and medium alcohol tolerance. It has an attenuation of 70.0%, making it ideal for creating light, crisp beers with a moderate amount of hops. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is between 9.0-11.0 Â°C, allowing brewers to achieve a good balance between maltiness and hop bitterness when fermenting their beer. This strain is perfect for creating classic German lagers such as Helles, Dortmunder Export, and more.</p>
