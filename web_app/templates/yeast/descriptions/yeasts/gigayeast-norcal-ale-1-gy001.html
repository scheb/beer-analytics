<p>The <em>NorCal Ale #1</em> (GY001) from GigaYeast is a liquid ale yeast designed for making beers with a clean, neutral flavor profile. It has an excellent attenuation of 78%, meaning it will ferment to the desired ABV quickly and efficiently. This yeast has a medium flocculation that helps it clump together and settle out of suspension at the end of fermentation. The ideal fermentation temperature range for this strain is 18-25 Â°C, so brewers should make sure to keep their fermentation temperatures within this range in order to get the best results.</p>
