<p>The <em>Hella Bock</em> (2487) liquid ale yeast by Wyeast is an excellent choice for producing a variety of flavorful German-style beers. Its medium flocculation and high attenuation of 72.0%, coupled with its alcohol tolerance of up to 12.0%, makes it an ideal choice for brewers looking to produce authentic bock-style lagers and ales. This strain also ferments best at temperatures between 9.0-13.0 Â°C, allowing brewers to effectively control the flavor profile of their finished product.</p>
