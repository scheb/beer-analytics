<p>The <em>Hornindal Kveik #5</em> (GY135) from GigaYeast is a liquid ale yeast that is ideal for homebrewing. This versatile strain has a medium attenuation of 77.0%, resulting in a well balanced beer with plenty of flavor and complexity. The flocculation is also medium, meaning the yeast will settle out nicely after fermentation without sacrificing flavor. This strain can tolerate medium alcohol levels, making it great for higher gravity beers as well as session beers. Its ideal fermentation temperature range is 10-38Â°C, allowing brewers to ferment at cooler temperatures if they want an additional layer of complexity while still achieving good attenuation.</p>
