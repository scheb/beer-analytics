<p>Lallemand's <em>WildBrew Helveticus Pitch</em> is a dry form of brett or bacteria, with low flocculation and low alcohol tolerance. It is ideal for fermentation temperatures ranging from 38.0-45.0Â°C, making it an excellent choice for brewers aiming to produce spontaneously fermented beer styles such as Geuze, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/lambic/">Lambic</a> and <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/oud-bruin/">Oud Bruin</a>. Its low alcohol tolerance makes it a perfect choice for producing sour beers due to the decreased risk of over attenuation or high acidity levels. In addition, its low flocculation characteristics make it easier for brewers to achieve the desired haze in their finished product.</p>
