<p>The <em>Munich Lager</em> from Escarpment Labs is a liquid lager yeast suitable for a range of lagers, including <a href="/styles/pale-malty-european-lager/munich-helles/">Munich Helles</a>, Dortmunder Export, and <a href="/styles/amber-bitter-european-beer/vienna-lager/">Vienna Lager</a>. With an attenuation of 78%, it produces a well-balanced beer with good body and mouthfeel. It has medium flocculation, so the yeast cells settle out quickly, and high alcohol tolerance to ensure that you get the full flavour potential from your grain bill. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 12.0-15.0Â°C, making it suitable for year-round brewing.</p>
