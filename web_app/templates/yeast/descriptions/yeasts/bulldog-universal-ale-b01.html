<p>The Bulldog <em>Universal Ale</em> (B01) is a dry ale yeast that is great for making classic ales. It has an attenuation of 73.0%, meaning it ferments the sugars in the wort to create a beer with medium body and lower alcohol content. This yeast also has medium flocculation, which helps give the beer a good clarity, as well as aid in creating a good head retention. The ideal fermentation temperature for this yeast is 18-23Â°C - any cooler and it will take longer to ferment, and any warmer might cause off-flavors or other issues. It also has a medium alcohol tolerance, so beers brewed with this yeast can have up to 6-7% ABV without any problems.</p>
