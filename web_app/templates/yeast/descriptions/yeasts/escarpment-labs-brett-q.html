<p>The <em>Brett Q</em> strain from Escarpment Labs is a liquid wild yeast that can be used to ferment both beer and wine. This strain is highly attenuative, meaning it will ferment out most of the available sugars in the wort or must and leave behind a dry, crisp finished product. It has a medium-low flocculation rate, so it won't create as much sediment or haze in the finished product as other strains. The <em>Brett Q</em> strain also has a high alcohol tolerance and can withstand up to 15% ABV without any ill effects. Finally, this strain ferments best at temperatures between 20-25°C (68-77°F). All these qualities make the <em>Brett Q</em> strain an ideal choice for those looking to add complexity and depth of flavor to their beers and wines.</p>
