It has a low flocculation rate and an attenuation rate of 48.0%, making it perfect for producing low ABV beers with a complex flavor. The Brett Blend #3 can tolerate up to 11.0% alcohol, so it can be used for higher ABV beers as well. Its ideal fermentation temperature is 20.0-27.0 Â°C, meaning it can work in most home brewing environments with some temperature control.</p>
