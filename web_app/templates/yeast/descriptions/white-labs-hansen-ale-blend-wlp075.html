<p>The <em>Hansen Ale Blend</em> (WLP075) from White Labs is a liquid ale yeast. It has a high attenuation of 77.0%, meaning it ferments the wort quickly and completely, producing dry beers. Its flocculation is medium, so it will leave some residual yeast in the beer after fermentation, adding complexity to the flavor profile. The alcohol tolerance is high, which makes it suitable for brewing <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">strong ales</a>. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is 19.0-21.0 °C (66-70°F). With its diverse properties and characteristics, this strain produces excellent results across a wide range of styles and can be used to brew everything from light ales to strong Belgians.</p>
