<p>White Labs <em>Belgian <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saison</a> III</em> (WLP585) is a liquid ale yeast that produces a highly attenuated and flavorful beer. With an attenuation of 72.0%, this yeast ferments quickly and efficiently, leaving behind a dry finish. The low flocculation of the yeast helps to keep haze in the beer, resulting in a refreshingly crisp flavor. This strain also has a medium alcohol tolerance, making it suitable for higher-alcohol beers. For best results, White Labs recommends fermenting at temperatures between 20.0-24.0 Â°C.</p>
