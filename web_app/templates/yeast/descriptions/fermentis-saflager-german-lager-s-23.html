<p>Fermentis' Saflager <em>German Lager</em> (S-23) is a dry lager yeast that produces beers with a high flocculation and an alcohol tolerance of up to 10.5%. It ferments best between 9.0-22.0Â°C and has an attenuation of 82.0%, meaning that it will produce beers with a slightly higher final gravity than most. The typical beer styles brewed with this yeast are light pilsners, <a href="/styles/standard-american-beer/american-lager/">American lagers</a>, bocks, and <a href="/styles/pale-malty-european-lager/munich-helles/">Munich Helles</a>. Its flavor profile is clean and neutral with hints of fruitiness, allowing the malt and hop flavors to shine through in the finished product.</p>
