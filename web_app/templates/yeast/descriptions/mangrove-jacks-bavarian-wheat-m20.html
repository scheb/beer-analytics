<p>Mangrove Jack's <em>Bavarian Wheat</em> (M20) is a dry ale yeast perfect for brewing classic wheat beers like Hefeweizens and <a href="/styles/german-wheat-beer/weizenbock/">Weizenbocks</a>. It has a low flocculation, meaning it will remain in suspension for an extended period of time, and produces an attenuation of 73%. The ideal fermentation temperature range for this yeast is 15.0-30.0 Â°C, and it produces a unique flavor profile with notes of banana, clove and bubblegum. This yeast is great for adding complexity and depth to traditional <a href="/styles/german-wheat-beer/">German wheat beer</a> styles such as Dunkelweizen, Kristallweizen and Weizenbock.</p>
