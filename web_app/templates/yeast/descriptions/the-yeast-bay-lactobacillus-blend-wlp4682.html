<p>The <em>Lactobacillus Blend</em> (WLP4682) from The Yeast Bay is a liquid form of brett or bacteria yeast. It has an attenuation of 80.0% and low flocculation, meaning that it will not clump together easily. Its alcohol tolerance is low and the ideal fermentation temperature range for it is 21.0-32.0 Â°C (70-90F). It's a great choice for producing sour beers with balanced acidity and funkiness, as well as for bottle conditioning to give off funky aromas and flavors in finished beer.</p>
