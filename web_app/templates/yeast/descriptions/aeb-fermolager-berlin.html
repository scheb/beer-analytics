<p><em>Fermolager Berlin</em> from AEB is a dry lager yeast that produces an 82.5% attenuation when fermented at 10.0-15.0Â°C. As a result, this lager yeast creates a crisp and clean flavor profile with minimal fruity esters, making it ideal for producing light and refreshing Pilsners, Lagers and other beers of similar character. Additionally, since <em>Fermolager Berlin</em> ferments at a lower temperature than most ale yeasts, it requires less time to achieve full attenuation, allowing brewers to produce beer quicker without sacrificing quality or flavor complexity.</p>
