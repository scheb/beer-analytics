<p>Omega Yeast Labs' <em>Pilsner II</em> (OYL-108) is a liquid lager yeast that offers excellent attenuation and medium-high flocculation. It is highly tolerant of alcohol up to 9.0%, and should be fermented at temperatures between 10.0-14.0 Â°C for optimal performance. This strain is ideal for creating light, crisp, and dry beers with a balanced malt character, making it perfect for creating classic pilsners and other Czech-style lagers.</p>
