<p>The <em>Uberweizen</em> from Escarpment Labs is a liquid ale yeast that is perfect for creating traditional wheat beer styles. With an attenuation level of 76%, it produces a highly fermentable wort that has a moderate alcohol content. Its flocculation level is medium, which means it will settle out quickly and lead to clearer beers. The alcohol tolerance is medium, so it can withstand some additional fermentation with higher gravity beers. Finally, the ideal fermentation temperature range of 18-24 degrees Celsius makes this yeast suitable for producing a variety of styles in many different climates.</p>
