<p>The <em>Chiswick Ale</em> (RVA 131) from RVA Yeast Labs is a liquid ale yeast perfect for producing classic English-style ales. It is characterized by very high flocculation and an attenuation of 68.5%, meaning it produces a beer with good body, not overly dry. Its alcohol tolerance is medium, so it can handle up to around 6-7% ABV without issue. The ideal fermentation temperature for this yeast is 18.0-21.0 Â°C, making it suitable for a wide range of temperatures.</p>
