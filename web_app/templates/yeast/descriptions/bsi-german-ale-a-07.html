<p>The <em>German Ale</em> (A-07) from BSI is a liquid ale yeast that has a low flocculation and low alcohol tolerance. It has an attenuation of 75.0% and is best used between 13.0 to 19.0 Â°C for optimal fermentation. This yeast is a great choice for creating traditional German-style lagers, ales, and wheat beers as it will bring out the subtle flavors of the malt while producing a light, crisp beer that's full of flavor.</p>
