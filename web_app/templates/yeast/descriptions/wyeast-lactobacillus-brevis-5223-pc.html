<p><em>Lactobacillus brevis</em> (5223-PC) from Wyeast is a liquid form of brett or bacteria with low flocculation, high alcohol tolerance and an ideal fermentation temperature of 16.0-35.0 Â°C. This strain of yeast produces a very tart flavor profile with an intense fruitiness. It is well suited for producing sour beers that are aged in oak barrels with wild yeasts and bacteria, as well as for fermenting cider, mead and other alcoholic beverages.</p>
