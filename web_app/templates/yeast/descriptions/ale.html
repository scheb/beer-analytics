<p>Ale yeast, scientifically known as <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, is a top-fermenting yeast known for its distinct characteristics that make it ideal for brewing specific styles of beer. It operates at warmer temperatures, typically between 15-24°C (59-75°F), which is in stark contrast to <a href="{% url "yeast_type" "lager" %}">lager yeast</a> that ferments at cooler temperatures. This warmer fermentation process allows ale yeast to metabolize sugars more quickly, resulting in a faster fermentation process. Ale yeast also produces more esters and phenols during fermentation, which contribute to a wide range of flavors and aromas, including fruity, spicy, and other complex notes.</p>

<p>This yeast strain contrasts with bottom-fermenting lager yeast (<em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em>) which tends to produce beers with cleaner, more subdued flavors. Ale yeast's flavor complexity makes it suitable for a multitude of beer styles including <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, stouts, porters, <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>, wheat beers, and many more. Its ability to create a variety of flavor profiles paired with its efficiency in warmer temperatures, positions ale yeast as a diverse and versatile yeast strain for both traditional and innovative beer brewing.</p>
