<p><em>Mangrove Jack's New World Strong Ale (M42)</em> is a high-performing dry ale yeast that offers brewers a versatile option for a wide range of ales. With its robust attenuation of 79.5%, it can effectively ferment sugars, resulting in a beer that is less sweet and more alcohol-forward. Its high flocculation characteristic means it clumps together and settles at the bottom of the fermenter after fermentation, contributing to clearer beer without the need for filtration or fining. This yeast is best used at an ideal fermentation temperature of 60.8-71.6°F (16.0-22.0°C), which can be readily maintained in most home brewing setups.</p>
