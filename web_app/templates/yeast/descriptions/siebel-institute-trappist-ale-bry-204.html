<p>The <em>Trappist Ale</em> (BRY 204) yeast strain from the Siebel Institute is a liquid form ale yeast with a medium flocculation and high attenuation of 78.0%. This strain is well suited to creating classic Belgian-style ales and produces a complex, spicy flavour profile. This unique yeast strain works best at temperatures between 18.0-22.0 Â°C for optimal fermentation and flavor development. It is an excellent choice for producing Abbey Ales, Dubbels, Tripels, Quads, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>, and other special <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a> that require fruity esters and phenolics to achieve their distinct character.</p>
