<p>White Labs' <em>Oktoberfest/Märzen Lager</em> (WLP820) is a liquid lager yeast type that has an attenuation of 69.0%, medium flocculation, and a medium alcohol tolerance. It ferments best at temperatures between 11.0-14.0°C, producing beers with a well-rounded flavor profile. This strain is ideal for brewing traditional Oktoberfest and <a href="/styles/amber-malty-european-lager/maerzen/">Märzen</a> lagers, as well as <a href="/styles/amber-bitter-european-beer/vienna-lager/">Vienna Lagers</a> and Bock beers. The flavor profile of these beers is characterized by notes of toasted bread crusts, caramel malts, and light fruitiness from the yeast esters. To maximize the smooth malty characteristics, it is recommended to ferment this strain at the lower end of its temperature range.</p>
