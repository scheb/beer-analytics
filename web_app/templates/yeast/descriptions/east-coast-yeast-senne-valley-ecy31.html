<p><em>Senne Valley</em> (ECY31) is a liquid ale yeast produced by East Coast Yeast. It has a high attenuation rate of 85.0%, resulting in beers with a crisp, dry finish. The flocculation rate is high, meaning that the yeast will settle quickly and form clumps for easy removal. This strain can tolerate high levels of alcohol, making it ideal for <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">strong ales</a> or <a href="/styles/specialty-beer/">specialty beers</a>. It ferments best at temperatures between 18.0-26.0Â°C, so you can use it in all kinds of recipes without worrying about temperature control.</p>
