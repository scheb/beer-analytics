<p>The <em>Trappist Blend</em> (3789) liquid ale yeast by Wyeast is an excellent choice for a wide range of Belgian-style beers. With an attenuation of 77.0%, it yields a slightly sweeter beer than usual, while its medium flocculation helps to create a clearer final product. It also has a relatively high alcohol tolerance of 12.0%, allowing it to ferment in higher gravity worts. It is best used within the temperature range of 20.0-29.0Â°C, making it suitable for most brewing conditions</p>
