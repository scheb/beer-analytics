<p>The <em>Fermentis Safale American Ale (US-05)</em> is a dry, ale type yeast known for its versatility and reliable performance. With an attenuation rate of 81.0%, it demonstrates a high capacity to ferment available sugars, resulting in a drier beer. The yeast exhibits a medium flocculation, meaning it forms moderate clumps and settles in the middle of the spectrum between high (clear beer) and low (cloudy beer). It has a low alcohol tolerance, making it ideal for brewing standard strength beers rather than high alcohol variants.</p>

<p>The <em>Safale US-05</em> thrives at fermentation temperatures between 53.6-77.0 °F (12.0-25.0 °C), accommodating a wide range of brewing environments. Typical beer styles brewed with this yeast include American Ales, Pale Ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, Porters, and Stouts, but its neutral flavor profile allows for diverse application across many styles. This yeast is appreciated for its clean, well-balanced and bright flavor profile, promoting the malt and hop character of the beer without introducing significant yeast-derived flavors. It is an excellent choice for brewers aiming for a true-to-style American craft beer character.</p>
