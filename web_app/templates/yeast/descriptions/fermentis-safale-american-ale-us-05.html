<p><em>US-05</em> is a popular dry beer yeast strain that is widely used by homebrewers and commercial breweries alike. It is a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a species of yeast that is commonly used in beer and wine fermentation. <em>US-05</em> is known for its clean, neutral flavor profile, which allows the malt and hop flavors in beer to shine through without any interference from the yeast. It is also known for its high attenuation rate, which means it ferments beer to a high level of alcohol content and a dry finish. This makes it particularly well-suited for brewing American-style ales, such as <a href="{{ "18"|style|url }}">pale ales</a>, <a href="{{ "21A"|style|url }}">IPAs</a>, and <a href="{{ "20A"|style|url }}">porters</a>.</p>
<p><em>Safale American Ale (US-05)</em> is a versatile yeast that can be used in a wide range of beer styles, including lagers, although it is most commonly used in ales. It is a dry yeast, which means it does not require rehydration before use, making it very convenient for homebrewers. It also has a relatively short lag time, which means it starts fermenting quickly after being pitched into the wort. Overall, it is a reliable and easy-to-use yeast that produces consistently good results.</p>
