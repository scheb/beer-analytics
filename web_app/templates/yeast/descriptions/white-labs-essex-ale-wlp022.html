<p>White Labs' <em>Essex Ale</em> (WLP022) is a liquid ale yeast that produces a full-bodied, malty beer. It has a high attenuation of 73.5%, with medium-high flocculation and an alcohol tolerance of medium. The ideal fermentation temperature for this strain is between 19.0 to 21.0 Â°C, making it an excellent choice for ales brewed in cooler temperatures. This yeast produces an estery flavor profile, which makes it perfect for traditional British-style ales such as pale ales, <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitters</a>, stouts, and porters.</p>
