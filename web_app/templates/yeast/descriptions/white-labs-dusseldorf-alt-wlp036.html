<p><em>Dusseldorf Alt</em> (WLP036) is a liquid ale yeast produced by White Labs. With an attenuation of 68.5%, this yeast has a medium flocculation and medium alcohol tolerance, making it well suited for higher-alcohol beers. The ideal fermentation temperature range is 18.0-22.0 °C, allowing brewers to have more control over the flavor profile of their beer. This yeast strain is commonly used to brew traditional German <a href="/styles/amber-bitter-european-beer/altbier/">altbier</a> styles, as well as other malty and slightly sweet ales such as Bock, Dunkelweizen, <a href="/styles/pale-malty-european-lager/munich-helles/">Munich Helles</a>, and <a href="/styles/pale-bitter-european-beer/koelsch/">Kölsch</a>. In these styles of beer, <em>Dusseldorf Alt</em> will impart a slight fruity ester character with notes of pear and apple along with a light bready maltiness.</p>
