<p>RVA Yeast Labs' <em>Golden Strong Ale</em> (RVA 251) is a liquid ale yeast perfect for creating stronger, maltier beers. It offers a high degree of attenuation at 76.5%, meaning that it will convert a lot of the sugars in the beer into alcohol, leading to a higher ABV. The flocculation of this yeast is medium, so it should form a good amount of sediment in the bottom of your fermenter. With an alcohol tolerance of up to 12%, this yeast can handle strong beers without any problems. Lastly, it works best when fermented between 20 and 24 degrees Celsius.</p>
