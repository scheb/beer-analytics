<p>Omega Yeast Labs' <em>Scottish Ale</em> (OYL-015) is a liquid ale yeast perfect for creating classic, malty ales. This yeast strain has a high attenuation rate of 75.0%, meaning it ferments quickly and leaves behind fewer residual sugars. It has a medium flocculation rate, which helps with clarity and body in the finished beer. This strain can tolerate up to 10.0% alcohol, so you can create boozier beers without worrying about your yeast giving out too soon. The ideal fermentation temperature range is between 18.0-21.0Â°C, making it an easy strain to work with in most environments and climates.</p>
