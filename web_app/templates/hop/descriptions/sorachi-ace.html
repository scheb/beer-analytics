<p><em>Sorachi Ace</em> hops, originally developed in Japan, have a fascinating history and a unique flavor profile that has captured the attention of homebrewers and professional brewers alike. This distinctive hop variety was created in the late 20th century through a collaborative effort between Sapporo Breweries and the Japanese Hop Growers Association. Named after the Sorachi Subprefecture on the northern island of Hokkaido, where it was first cultivated, <em>Sorachi Ace</em> is the product of crossing <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a> and <a href="/hops/bittering/brewers-gold/">Brewer's Gold</a> hops, the offspring then being crossed with a Beikei No. 2 male (a Japanese variety). It was intended to combine the best characteristics of both parent varieties, creating a hop that was both flavorful and well-suited for the Japanese brewing industry.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't until 2006 that the variety gained more widespread recognition, thanks to its introduction to the American craft beer scene. <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/moutere/">Brooklyn</a> Brewery was one of the first breweries to use <em>Sorachi Ace</em> in the United States, and their eponymous saison made this hop variety a favorite among craft beer enthusiasts and homebrewers alike.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Sorachi Ace</em> hops is truly one-of-a-kind, boasting a mix of bright citrus notes, predominantly lemon zest, and a distinct dill-like herbaceousness. This unique combination makes it an ideal choice for adventurous homebrewers looking to experiment with new tastes and aromas in their beer. <em>Sorachi Ace</em> hops are versatile and can be used for both bittering and aroma additions, with an alpha acid content typically ranging from 10 to 16%. They are especially well-suited for <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, and <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">witbiers</a>, adding a refreshing twist and depth to these beer styles. When using <em>Sorachi Ace</em> hops in your homebrew, start with a smaller amount and adjust to your taste preference, as the bold flavors can easily dominate the final product if used excessively.</p>
