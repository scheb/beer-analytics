<p><em>Sorachi Ace</em> was originally developed by Sapporo Brewery in Hokkaido, Japan in the late 20th century. It is a cross between Brewer's Gold, Saaz, and a wild Japanese hop variety BeiKei No.2. In 2006 it was resurrected in the USA and since then has gained popularity among craft brewers for its unique flavor profile.</p>

<p><em>Sorachi Ace</em> is known for its lemony, herbal, and spicy notes, which make it a great addition to a variety of beer styles, particularly saison and Belgian-style ales. Its distinct flavor profile is due to its high concentration of a compound called geraniol, which is also found in lemons and roses. The hop is typically used as a finishing hop, meaning it is added towards the end of the brewing process to impart its unique flavor and aroma.</p>
