<p><em>Sorachi Ace</em> is a type of hops that was developed in Japan in the late 20th century. It is a cross between Brewer's Gold, Saaz, and a wild Japanese hop variety. The hop was first introduced to the market by the Sapporo Brewery in 2006, and it has since gained popularity among craft brewers for its unique flavor profile.</p>

<p><em>Sorachi Ace</em> is known for its lemony, herbal, and spicy notes, which make it a great addition to a variety of beer styles, particularly saison and Belgian-style ales. Its distinct flavor profile is due to its high concentration of a compound called geraniol, which is also found in lemons and roses. The hop is typically used as a finishing hop, meaning it is added towards the end of the brewing process to impart its unique flavor and aroma.</p>
