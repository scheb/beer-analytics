However, it's the hop's unique aroma and flavor profile that has made it a popular choice for late-stage additions and dry hopping. <em>Nectaron</em> hops are well-suited for use in IPAs, pale ales, and other hop-forward styles, and are known for imparting a bright and juicy character to these beers.</p>
