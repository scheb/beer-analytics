<p><em>Nectaron</em>, previously known as experimental hop HORT 4337, are a relatively new variety developed by New Zealandâ€™s Plant &amp;amp; Food Research and released in 2019. <em>Nectaron</em> is a daughter to Pacific Jade and a sister to Waimea. Known for its intense tropical fruit flavors, including notes of passionfruit, peach, and grapefruit, it also has a subtle spiciness that adds complexity to its flavor profile.</p>

<p><em>Nectaron</em> hops are a dual-purpose hop, meaning they can be used for both bittering and aroma purposes in beer. They have a relatively high alpha acid content, ranging from 10 to 12%, which makes them suitable for bittering. However, it's the hop's unique aroma and flavor profile that has made it a popular choice for late-stage additions and dry hopping. <em>Nectaron</em> hops are well-suited for use in IPAs, pale ales, and other hop-forward styles, and are known for imparting a bright and juicy character to these beers.</p>
