<p><em>Bobek</em> hops, a diploid hybrid, were bred in the Zalec region of Slovenia, alongside <a href="/hops/aroma/blisk/">Blisk</a> and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/buket/">Buket</a>. The aim was to create a cultivar with both high alpha and good aroma. The parents of <em>Bobek</em> are <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/northern-brewer/">Northern Brewer</a> and a Slovenian male. Despite its pleasant floral aroma and high alpha, <em>Bobek</em> is not being commercially produced at this time.</p>

<p><em>Bobek</em> hops are recognized for their intense and pleasant aroma, characterized by floral and pine overtones. They are typically used for bittering in the beer brewing process. The overall aroma profile is further characterized by distinct notes of lemon and grapefruit, green fruits, and sage. This is complemented by spicy aniseed extracts and some sweetness. Further slight vegetal elements, such as artichoke, are combined with woody hay-like aromas. <em>Bobek</em> hops are known for their good agronomic properties and offer excellent brewing value due to their pleasant hoppy aroma and excellent bitterness.</p>
