<p><em>Southern Cross</em> hops, a product of New Zealand's hop breeding program, were first released in 1994. They are a triploid cross between the New Zealand variety Smoothcone and a 1950â€™s research variety bred from a crossing of an early North American type known as the Cali (short for Californian) with the ubiquitous English <a href="/hops/aroma/fuggle/">Fuggle</a>. This hop variety is characterized by its excellent essential oil profile and low cohumulone, which delivers a delicate balance of citrus and spice when added at the end of the boil.</p>

<p><em>Southern Cross</em> hops are dual-purpose, meaning they can be used for both bittering and aroma. They are known for their high alpha acid content, which contributes to their bittering potential, and their unique flavor profile, which includes notes of citrus, particularly lemon zest, pine, and spice. These hops are often used in a variety of beer styles, including Pale Ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, and Lagers. The low cohumulone levels of <em>Southern Cross</em> make it a versatile early-kettle addition in almost any style. However, its pine/citrus aromas are definitely welcome in hoppy American styles.</p>
