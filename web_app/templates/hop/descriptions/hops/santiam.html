<p><em>Santiam</em> hops, developed in the United States, are a product of Swiss <a href="/hops/aroma/tettnanger/">Tettnanger</a>, German <a href="/hops/aroma/hallertauer-mittelfrueh/">Hallertauer Mittelfr√ºh</a>, and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/cascade/">Cascade</a> parentage. Released in 1997 by the USDA, these hops were bred in Corvallis, Oregon, and are adapted to the growing conditions in all major hop-growing areas in Oregon and Washington. As a triploid variety, <em>Santiam</em> produces nearly seedless cones, even in the presence of male pollinators. This hop variety is known for its soft, herbal, floral, and fruity aromas with hints of pepper and spice, making it an ideal aroma hop for brewing.</p>

<p><em>Santiam</em> hops are typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping, and are often used to enhance the aroma of India and <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a>. The hops are small but have good downy mildew resistance; however, they are susceptible to powdery mildew. The yield of <em>Santiam</em> may be as high as 2,400 kg/ha (2,000 lb/acre), significantly higher than that of Tettnanger, one of its parent hops.</p>
