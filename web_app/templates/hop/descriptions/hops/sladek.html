<p><em>Sl치dek</em> hops, named after the Czech word for brewer, are characterized by high yields and are widely appreciated for their balanced aroma profile and bitterness. This hop variety is a cross between <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/northern-brewer/">Northern Brewer</a> and <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a>, bringing together the best of both worlds. <em>Sl치dek</em> hops are known for their fruity flavor profile, characterized by citrus, grapefruit, and green fruits. In addition, red berries, such as cassis, currant, and strawberry, have a strong influence on the aroma formation. These are complemented by slight vegetal notes of dill. In the cold infusion, sweet fruit aromas, such as passion fruit and peach, add to the overall impression, while overtones of coffee complete the remarkable flavor spectrum.</p>

<p><em>Sl치dek</em> is an aroma hop that is typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping. It is noted to be a good complement to Saaz in late-hopping applications. The hop's fruity flavor profile with essences of peach, passion fruit, and grapefruit makes it a popular choice for brewers. Some popular beer styles that make use of the <em>Sl치dek</em> hop include Lager, Pilsner, and <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPA</a>.</p>
