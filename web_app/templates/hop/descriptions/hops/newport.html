<p><em>Newport</em> hops, a variety bred by the USDA and Oregon State University, were released in 2002 as a response to concerns over mildew resistance. This variety is a descendant of the Hallertauer <a href="/hops/bittering/magnum/">Magnum</a> and a USDA male variety, and it played a crucial role in saving the Northwest US hops production when mildew issues threatened multiple hops varieties. <em>Newport</em> hops are known for their high alpha acid, cohumulone, and myrcene content, which offer more distinct aroma characteristics than its parent.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Newport</em> hops is quite diverse, with descriptors ranging from earthy and citrus to wine and balsamic. However, due to its high alpha content, it is primarily used early in the boil for clean bitterness. <em>Newport</em> hops are an excellent choice for homebrewers looking for a bittering variety that works well across a wide range of beer styles. They are particularly suited to beers requiring a clean profile, such as Barley Wine, Stout, and various Ales. Despite its bittering qualities, <em>Newport</em> hops have been described as somewhat pungent and resiny, offering a balanced bittering profile with low aromatics.</p>
