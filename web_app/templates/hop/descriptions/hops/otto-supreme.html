<p><em>Otto Supreme</em> is an experimental hop variety that has been developed by Brulotte Farms, Inc. This hop variety is known for its rich and complex flavor profile, which includes a wealth of stone fruit, tropical guava, and pineapple, along with subtle notes of fresh berries. This unique blend of flavors makes <em>Otto Supreme</em> a versatile hop that can add depth and complexity to a variety of beer styles.</p>

<p>In terms of brewing, <em>Otto Supreme</em> has been used in hop bursting and double dry hopping techniques in the brewing of <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>. However, it's important to note that the aroma and flavor imparted by <em>Otto Supreme</em> can be subtle. For instance, in a comparison brew where an <a href="/styles/ipa/">IPA</a> was split and one half was dry hopped with <em>Otto Supreme</em> and the other with <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/ekuanot/">Equinox</a> (HBC 366), the <em>Otto Supreme</em> half resulted in a beer with very little aroma, characterized by a faint grassiness and fruitiness. The taste was similar, with the malt easily shining through due to the subtle hop character. By contrast, the Equinox half was significantly more aromatic and flavorful. Therefore, while <em>Otto Supreme</em> can contribute unique flavors to a beer, it may not be the best choice if you're looking for a hop that will provide a strong, dominant hop character.</p>
