<p><em>Kazbek</em> hops, developed in the Czech Republic, are a product of a cross between a wild Russian variety and the daughter of <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a> and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/northern-brewer/">Northern Brewer</a>. This cross was made in 1984, but <em>Kazbek</em> was officially released only in 2008. The hop is named after one of the highest mountains in the Caucasus Range, reflecting its wild Russian heritage.</p>

<p><em>Kazbek</em> is often referred to as a "Super Saaz" due to its amplified aroma profile compared to its parent, Saaz. It offers a unique blend of citrus, sweet fruits, and berries, while retaining the classic noble spice. The predominant aromas include grapefruit, lemon, and lime, accompanied by sweet fruits such as pineapple, passion fruit, peach, and watermelon. Light top notes of honey and cream caramel are also present. These aromas also occur in the raw hops where they are joined by nuances of raspberries, orange, ginger, elderberries, and chocolate. Light notes of lemon balm add particular emphasis to the overall aroma.</p>
