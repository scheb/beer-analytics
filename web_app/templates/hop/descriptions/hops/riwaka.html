<p><em>Riwaka</em> hops, also known as <em>D Saaz</em>, are a unique aroma hop variety originating from New Zealand. They were bred during the development of New Zealand Hops' 'hops with a difference' programme, and were officially released to the brewing world in 1997. The breeding process involved crossing the &quot;Old Line&quot; <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a> with specially developed New Zealand breeding selections. <em>Riwaka</em> hops are known for their abundant oil content, which is nearly twice that of its Saazer parent, contributing to its distinct flavor profile.</p>

<p><em>Riwaka</em> hops are characterized by their extreme citrus notes, with aromas of passionfruit, grapefruit, lemon, and other tropical fruits. This powerful grapefruit and citrusy character is literally breathtaking during selection, making <em>Riwaka</em> a standout variety. The pure weight of the oil character experienced during selection carries right through to the glass, making it a punchy addition to new world styles of Pale Ales and New Zealand Pilseners. It's also suitable for big styles such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> and Imperial Pilsners. Some brewers even consider <em>Riwaka</em> the &quot;ultimate&quot; hop for hoppy beers due to its strong sweet citrus note. If you're a homebrewer looking to say &quot;New Zealand Hops&quot; in your beer, <em>Riwaka</em> is an excellent choice.</p>
