<p><em>Minstrel</em> hops are an intriguing variety, originating from the United Kingdom and developed by Charles Faram Hop Development Programme. This dual-purpose hop was introduced to the market in 2012, and its lineage can be traced back to both the classic British hop, <a href="/hops/bittering/sovereign/">Sovereign</a>, and a wild American hop. This genetic combination provides the <em>Minstrel</em> hop with its distinct aroma and flavor profiles.</p>

<p>The <em>Minstrel</em> hop's flavor profile is notable for its pleasant mix of fruity and floral notes, with undertones of earthy and spicy characteristics. It imparts flavors and aromas reminiscent of orange marmalade, ripe red berries, and hints of sweet herbal notes. With an alpha acid content typically ranging between 6-8%, <em>Minstrel</em> hops are well-suited for both bittering and aroma contributions in your brews. This versatility makes them an ideal choice for traditional British styles such as ESB, <a href="/styles/british-bitter/strong-bitter/">English Pale Ale</a>, and Porter, as well as modern craft beer styles like <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ale</a>, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPA</a>, and even Belgian-inspired ales.</p>
