<p><em>Mount Rainier</em> hops, a dual-purpose variety, were bred by Oregon State University. The hop is a cross between <a href="/hops/bittering/magnum/">Magnum</a> and USDA 19085M, developed in 1994 and released to the public in 2009. This hop variety boasts noble aroma characteristics similar to the German <a href="/hops/aroma/hallertauer-mittelfrueh/">Hallertauer Mittelfr√ºh</a> variety but with added bittering strength. The aroma profile of <em>Mount Rainier</em> hops is a complex blend of citrus, earthy, fruity, and herbal notes. Specific descriptors for this hop include grass, cedar, lemon, and tea, along with noble, licorice, and floral bouquet elements. This unique blend of scents gives it a versatile flavor and aroma that can be used in various stages of the brewing process.</p>

<p><em>Mount Rainier</em> hops are well-suited for brewing various beer styles, including lagers, American ales, and porters. They also work well in German-inspired beers like Pilsners or Helles and can add a subtle, balancing bitterness and complex aroma to rich, roasty stouts. The hop oil breakdown typically includes a high percentage of Myrcene (58-59%), which contributes to its green, resinous aroma, and Humulene (17-18%), which imparts woody, piney notes.</p>
