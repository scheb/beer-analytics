<p><em>Strisselspalt</em> hops originate from the Alsace region of France, around Strasbourg, and are likely related to German Spalt and/or <a href="/hops/aroma/hersbrucker/">Hersbrucker</a> hops. They are considered an old landrace, meaning they have developed naturally over time, without intentional breeding. Despite their relatively low yield, <em>Strisselspalt</em> hops continue to be cultivated due to strong domestic demand for the variety.</p>
