<p><em>Aramis</em> hops, a product of the Comptoir Agricole breeding program, were first created in 2002. This variety hails from the Alsace region in France and is a cross between the traditional <a href="/hops/aroma/strisselspalt/">Strisselspalt</a> and <a href="/hops/aroma/whitbread-golding/">Whitbread Golding</a>. <em>Aramis</em> was the first new variety from this research program, and it was designed to retain the excellent aroma of Strisselspalt while providing a more stable and abundant bittering quality. The most significant aroma hop variety in the Alsace region is Strisselspalt, and <em>Aramis</em> was developed to offer a similar aroma profile but with an increased and stable <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> potential.</p>

<p><em>Aramis</em> hops are known for their sweet and spicy characteristics, with a flavor profile that includes notes of caramel, mint, lemon grass, and rose. They also offer sweet floral aromas like jasmine, herbal extracts, and hay, with a sweet fruity promise of strawberries and raspberries and an expression of spicy notes, rose, and lemon balm. This variety is typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping, due to its aroma and higher oil and alpha content. It has been used commercially in beers such as New Belgium Hop Kitchenâ€™s French <em>Aramis</em>, a dry, refreshing <a href="/styles/ipa/">India Pale Ale</a>. <em>Aramis</em> is perfect for traditional styles like pilsners, but it also works well in more modern twists to the style.</p>
