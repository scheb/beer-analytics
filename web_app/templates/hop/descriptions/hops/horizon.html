<p><em>Horizon</em> hops are an American hop variety with a unique and enticing profile. Developed in the late 20th century by the USDA, this versatile hop is a result of a cross-breeding program that aimed to improve the resistance and yield of hop plants while maintaining the desirable flavor and aroma characteristics. <em>Horizon</em> hops are a close relative of the popular <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/nugget/">Nugget</a> hop variety.</p>

<p><em>Horizon</em> hops are celebrated for their clean, crisp flavor profile, characterized by a delicate blend of floral, citrus, and spicy notes. With a moderate alpha acid content typically ranging from 11-13%, <em>Horizon</em> hops can provide the perfect balance of bitterness and aroma for a wide range of beer styles. The subtle earthiness of these hops pairs well with the fruity esters often found in American-style <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, pale ales, and even some lagers. Additionally, their low cohumulone content results in a smooth and clean bitterness, making them an excellent choice for bittering as well as late additions and dry hopping. As a homebrewer, incorporating <em>Horizon</em> hops into your next brew will not only introduce a refined and versatile flavor profile but also create a delightful sensory experience for beer enthusiasts.</p>
