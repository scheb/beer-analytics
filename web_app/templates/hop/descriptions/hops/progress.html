<p><em>Progress</em> hops, developed at Wye College in the UK in 1951 and released for commercial growing in 1964, were introduced as a replacement for <a href="/hops/aroma/fuggle/">Fuggle</a>. They were bred as a seedling of <a href="/hops/aroma/whitbread-golding/">Whitbread <a href="/hops/aroma/golding/">Golding</a> Variety</a> (WGV) crossed with OB79. <em>Progress</em> hops are known for their tolerance to wilt, but they are susceptible to powdery and downy mildews. The hops are characterized by a tall structure with a cone structure similar but more open than that of Fuggle.</p>

<p>The aroma characteristics of <em>Progress</em> hops include sweet grass, floral, mint, and earthy flavor tones. They are typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping. The hops have a full-bodied and well-rounded bittering characteristic, making them excellent for both bittering and late aroma hop applications. They are particularly suited to a wide range of traditional British ales, including <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitters</a>, pale ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, milds, browns, and <a href="/styles/scottish-ale/">Scottish ales</a>. <em>Progress</em> hops can also add a nice element to <a href="/styles/brown-british-beer/english-porter/">brown porters</a>.</p>
