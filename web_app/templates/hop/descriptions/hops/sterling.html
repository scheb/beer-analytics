<p><em>Sterling</em> hops, a popular choice among homebrewers, were developed in the late 20th century by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a result of a breeding program in Corvallis, Oregon that aimed to create a domestic alternative to European noble hops. The <em>Sterling</em> hop variety is a genetic cross between <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a>, Brewerâ€™s Gold, <a href="/hops/aroma/early-green/">Early Green</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/cascade/">Cascade</a> and another unknown variety. It was first released in 1998 and has since gained popularity for its versatility in brewing various beer styles.</p>

<p><em>Sterling</em> hops are appreciated for their distinct yet mild floral and spicy characteristics, often described as having notes of citrus, herbs, and black pepper. This unique flavor profile makes <em>Sterling</em> hops particularly suitable for brewing a wide range of beer styles, including lagers, pilsners, and <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>. The moderate alpha acid content, typically ranging from 6 to 9%, enables it to function as both a bittering and aroma hop. When used for bittering, <em>Sterling</em> hops provide a clean, smooth bitterness that complements and enhances the flavors of the malt. As an aroma hop, the subtle and refined character of <em>Sterling</em> lends itself well to late additions and dry hopping, offering a gentle and refined bouquet that won't overpower the beer's other flavors. Whether you're a seasoned homebrewer or just starting your journey, incorporating <em>Sterling</em> hops into your brewing repertoire can add an elegant touch to your creations.</p>
