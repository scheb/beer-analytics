<p><em>Southern Passion</em> is a unique hop variety that originates from South Africa, with its genetic roots tracing back to Europe. It is the result of a cross between Czech <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a> and German Hallertauer, two well-known hop varieties. <em>Southern Passion</em> is typically harvested in the late summer months, which in South Africa is around late February into March. This hop variety is primarily used for its aroma, and it is often incorporated in late boil additions, including dry hopping.</p>

<p><em>Southern Passion</em> is renowned for its complex and unique flavor profile. It imparts a range of tropical fruit flavors to the beer, including passion fruit, guava, red berries, and melon. There are also notes of coconut, tangerine, grapefruit, and a unique floral note described as calendula. Some brewers also detect a woody undertone. This hop works well with a variety of beer styles, including lightly hopped session beers, Pilsners, and all hop-forward beers of American and Belgian origins such as pale ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, and <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>.</p>
