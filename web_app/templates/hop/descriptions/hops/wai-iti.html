<p><em>Wai-iti</em> hops are a relatively new variety, developed by New Zealand Plant and Food Research and released from the New Zealand Hop breeding Programme in 2011. This hop is a granddaughter of the USDA developed <a href="/hops/aroma/liberty/">Liberty</a>, and is a triploid hop derived from 1/3rd Hallertau Mittelfr√ºh. It was selected for its low alpha acid and high oils content, which contribute to its unique flavor profile. <em>Wai-iti</em> hops are typically harvested in late February or March and continue through to early April.</p>

<p>The flavor and aroma profile of <em>Wai-iti</em> hops are lush and fragrant, with dominant notes of stone fruit, notably peach and apricot. These hops also bring pleasantly intense tropical citrus tones of lime and mandarin. The high oil content fills in all the corners when used in late additions, the hop back, or in dry hopping. The low cohumulone and high levels of farnesene create a rounded clean bitterness when used in single hopped beers. This hop variety is typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping, and is commonly used in Pale Ale, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPA</a>, Wheat Beer, and Pilsner styles. If <em>Wai-iti</em> hops are hard to find, <a href="/hops/aroma/riwaka/">Riwaka</a> hops can be used as a substitute.</p>
