<p><em>Waimea</em> hops, a dual-purpose variety, were first released in 2012 by The New Zealand Institute for Plant &amp; Food Research Limited. This variety traces its parentage back to Californian Late <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/cluster/">Cluster</a>, <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a>, and <a href="/hops/aroma/fuggle/">Fuggle</a>. The <em>Waimea</em> hop is known for its high alpha acid content, ranging from 14.5-19%, and its low cohumulone content, which contributes to a smoother bitterness in beer. It also has a high oil content, which imparts a rich flavor and aroma to the brew.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Waimea</em> hops is characterized by a strong presence of pine and citrus notes, with a particular emphasis on tangelo or mandarin. This makes it well-suited for dual-purpose applications, from early kettle additions to dry hopping. The unique combination of quality bitterness and fresh citrus aroma notes makes <em>Waimea</em> hops a popular choice for a wide array of beer styles, including Pale Ale, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPA</a>, and Lager. The high oil content and the unique flavor profile make <em>Waimea</em> hops an excellent choice for homebrewers looking to experiment with bold, flavorful brews.</p>
