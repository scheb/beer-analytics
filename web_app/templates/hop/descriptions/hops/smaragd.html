<p><em>Smaragd</em>, meaning &quot;emerald&quot; in German, is a fine aroma variety that was bred at the Hop Research Institute in Hüll, Germany. It was developed as a disease-resistant alternative to Hallertau Mittelfrüh and was released for large-scale production in 2000. This hop is known for its high yield and good disease characteristics. It is predominantly grown in Germany, where it matures mid-late in the season.</p>

<p>The <em><em>Smaragd</em></em> hop has a unique flavor profile that combines spicy, herbal characteristics, such as liquorice, thyme, and tarragon, with sweet fruity and vegetal notes. It also has a cognac-like woody character that contributes to its special flavor. The hop is commonly used for bittering in beer brewing, but it also imparts floral, spicy, and mild fruity aromas. It is primarily used in Bavarian lagers and Belgian-style ales.</p>
