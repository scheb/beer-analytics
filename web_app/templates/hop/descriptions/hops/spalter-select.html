<p><em>Spalter Select</em> is a German aroma hop variety that was bred at the Hop Research Institute in Hüll in the Hallertau region of Bavaria. It was released in 1993 and registered for commercial cultivation the same year. The variety has a rather complicated genetic makeup, largely derived from Hallertauer Mittelfrueh and Spalt. The aim of its creation was to increase yield potential and disease resistance, serving as a commercial replacement for Spalt. The efforts were successful, and <em>Spalter Select</em> is now often referred to simply as &quot;Select&quot;. It is characterized by a good tolerance to diseases like wilt and downy mildew.</p>

<p>The aroma of <em>Spalter Select</em> is unique and easy to distinguish from either Hallertauer Mittelfrueh or Spalter-Spalt. It has some background spicy and herbal notes that are similar to these hops, but it also has a characteristic heavy, sweet, almost candy-like aroma that makes it instantly recognizable. In addition, it offers a range of unusual aromas, combining thyme and apple blossoms with spicy-herbal wormwood and tart citrus fruits. <em>Spalter Select</em> is an aroma hop that is typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping. It is often used in brewing styles such as <a href="/styles/pale-bitter-european-beer/koelsch/">Kölsch</a>, <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian Ale</a>, French Ale, Lager, Bock, Helles, Alt, Pilsner, and Marzen.
