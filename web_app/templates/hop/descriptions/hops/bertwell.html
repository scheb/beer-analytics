<p><em>Bertwell</em> hops have a fascinating origin story. They were discovered growing wild near Picton, Ontario, and subsequent test brews and laboratory studies have led to the belief that this variety may be a survivor from Ontario’s original pioneer brewing days, when Upper Canada was a barley belt for the British Empire. The hops were named <em>Bertwell</em> in honor of Bert Grant, a renowned craft brewer and hop lover, and Wellington County, the site of their first commercial hopyard. It's thought that these plants are probably British survivors from Prince Edward County’s 'Barley Days', a period when Upper Canada was a barley and hop growing stronghold of the British Empire.</p>
