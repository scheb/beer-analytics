<p><em>Summit</em> hops, a high alpha acid variety, were developed by the American Dwarf Hop Association (ADHA) and released in 2003. They are a product of a breeding program initiated in 1992, which aimed to create a distinct, high-yielding hop variety with excellent disease resistance. <em>Summit</em> hops are the result of a cross between Lexus and an unspecified male derived from numerous hops varieties, including <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/columbus/">Zeus</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/nugget/">Nugget</a>, and male USDA varieties. The hop's unique genetic background and dwarf growth habit make it an ideal candidate for the modern brewing industry. <em>Summit</em> hops are predominantly grown in the United States, with the Yakima Valley in Washington State being the primary growing region.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Summit</em> hops is characterized by its bold, intense, and distinctive aromas. With an alpha acid content typically ranging from 16-18%, <em>Summit</em> hops are well-suited for bittering purposes, providing a clean and crisp bitterness to beer. Aroma-wise, <em>Summit</em> hops are known for their pungent and complex notes of tangerine, orange, and grapefruit, as well as earthy undertones and hints of spice. These characteristics make <em>Summit</em> hops particularly popular in the brewing of American-style <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Double IPAs</a>, and <a href="/styles/american-porter-and-stout/imperial-stout/">Imperial Stouts</a>, where their assertive flavors can shine.</p>

<p>As a homebrewer, <em>Summit</em> hops can be a valuable addition to your brewing toolkit, especially if you're looking to create hop-forward beers with assertive citrus and earthy flavors. Due to their high alpha acid content, <em>Summit</em> hops are best used as a bittering hop addition early in the boil, while its aromatic qualities can be accentuated with a late addition or dry hopping. Experimenting with <em>Summit</em> hops in combination with other hop varieties can also yield exciting results, as their strong flavor profile can complement and contrast with other hop profiles, creating a unique and complex beer.</p>
