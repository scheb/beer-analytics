<p><em>Bullion</em> hops, a sister selection to <a href="/hops/bittering/brewers-gold/">Brewer's Gold</a>, were first bred in 1919 at Wye College, England. The hops originate from a wild hop cutting sourced from Manitoba, Canada. <em>Bullion</em> hops were officially released in 1938 and were once popular in professional brewing circles. However, their production capacity has been reduced in favor of super-alpha varieties with greater bittering potential and increased storage stability. Despite this, <em>Bullion</em> hops are still used in brewing, particularly for darker beers.</p>

<p><em>Bullion</em> hops are known for their high alpha acids and an incredibly high yield. They produce a heavy crop of large cones and feature zesty, herbal, and spicy flavors with predominantly dark red fruit notes, similar to blackcurrant. The bitterness of <em>Bullion</em> hops is considered slightly coarse by some, and they are often used for mid to late additions in the brewing process.</p>
