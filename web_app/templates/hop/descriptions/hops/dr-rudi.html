<p><em>Dr. Rudi</em> hops, originally known as SuperAlpha, were first released in 1976 by the New Zealand Horticultural Research Center. The variety was renamed in 2012 to honor <em>Dr. Rudi</em> Roborgh, who is considered the father of New Zealand's hop program. <em>Dr. Rudi</em> is a triploid variety bred from an open cross of Smoothcone, a New Zealand hop variety. Initially marketed as a bittering hop due to its relatively high alpha acid content, <em>Dr. Rudi</em> is now viewed as a dual-purpose variety, contributing notes of bright pine, lemon, and sweet grass when used later in the brewing process.</p>

<p>The <em>Dr. Rudi</em> hop variety is characterized by its lemongrass-pine character and is known for its versatility. It was initially intended as a bittering hop, but its oil profile suits modern craft styles very well, making it a popular choice for hoppy lagers, <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitters</a>, and pale ales. The aroma profile of <em>Dr. Rudi</em> is moderate, with sweetly grassy overtones and hints of lemongrass, pine sap, and dried fruit. When used as a late addition in brewing, these aromas become evident in the top notes. The hop is also known for its crisp and clean bittering qualities.</p>
