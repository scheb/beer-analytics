<p><em>Amarillo</em> has become increasingly popular among craft beer enthusiasts and homebrewers alike since their introduction in 2003. Developed by Virgil Gamache Farms in Washington State, these hops are a proprietary variety characterized by their high alpha acid content, typically ranging from 8-11%, which makes them an excellent choice for both bittering and aroma additions in the brewing process. <em>Amarillo</em> hops are a product of a chance discovery; they emerged as a spontaneous mutation in the hop fields in 1990 and were subsequently cultivated and patented for their unique and desirable characteristics.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Amarillo</em> hops boasts a distinct blend of citrus, floral, and tropical fruit notes, often compared to grapefruit, orange, and even a hint of pineapple. These characteristics make them highly sought after by homebrewers looking to create bold, fruit-forward beers that are both refreshing and complex. <em>Amarillo</em> hops are especially well-suited for American-style Pale Ales, <a href="/styles/ipa/">India Pale Ales</a> (<a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>), and <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Double IPAs</a>, where their vibrant flavors and aromas can truly shine. Additionally, these hops can be used to add a fruity twist to other styles such as Blondes, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>, and Wheat Beers.</p>

<p>When brewing with <em>Amarillo</em> hops, homebrewers should consider their desired level of bitterness, aroma, and flavor contribution to the final product. A higher alpha acid content can lead to increased bitterness when added earlier in the boil, while late boil or whirlpool additions can emphasize the fruity and floral notes. Experimenting with <em>Amarillo</em> hops as a single-hop variety or in combination with other hop types can yield exciting results and help you create a truly unique and memorable beer.</p>
