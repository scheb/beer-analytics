<p><em>Hallertau</em> hops, originally from Germany, have found a home in the United States. The American-grown <em>Hallertau</em> hop is a tenacious, Bavarian-style hop that is still in demand by craft brewers for Bavarian-style ales. Despite being outperformed by Mount Hood and Liberty in the American hop market, it continues to hold its own. The <em>US Hallertau</em> originates from the classic Hallertauer Mittelfrüh variety of Germany and is harvested in mid-to-late August for most aroma varieties. It is mild and pleasant, yet spicy, with herbal and floral characteristics. Its low alpha acids (3.5%-5.5%) and high humulene contribute to a mild, flowery, and delicately spicy aroma and flavor profile, which is a hallmark of the original German-grown Hallertau that has long been the staple of German and European lagers.</p>

<p>You might find the <em>Hallertau (US)</em> hop to be an interesting addition to your brewing repertoire. It's typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping, and can impart a unique flavor profile to your brews. If you're unable to find <em>Hallertau (US)</em> hops, you can substitute them with similar hop varieties such as Liberty, Mount Hood, Crystal, or the original Hallertauer Tradition and Hallertauer Mittelfrüh varieties from Germany.</p>
