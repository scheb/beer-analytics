<p><em>Cashmere</em> hops are a relatively recent addition to the world of hop varieties, with a distinctive flavor profile that has quickly gained popularity among craft brewers and homebrewers alike. Originating in the United States, <em>Cashmere</em> hops were developed by Washington State University and released to the public in 2013. The result of a cross between <a href="/hops/aroma/cascade/">Cascade</a> and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/northern-brewer/">Northern Brewer</a> hops, <em>Cashmere</em> boasts an impressive lineage, which contributes to its unique and highly sought-after characteristics.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Cashmere</em> hops is often described as complex and multi-layered, offering a blend of fruity and tropical notes, such as melon, lemon, and lime, combined with herbal and spicy undertones. This versatile hop variety also imparts a smooth bitterness, which makes it suitable for a range of beer styles. Most commonly, <em>Cashmere</em> hops are used in <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, pale ales, and other hop-forward beers, where their exceptional aroma and flavor can truly shine. However, they also work well as a supporting hop in more malt-forward styles, such as porters and stouts, adding a touch of brightness and complexity to the brew. When experimenting with <em>Cashmere</em> hops in your homebrew, consider using them for late additions, whirlpool, or dry hopping to fully capture their remarkable aroma and taste.</p>
