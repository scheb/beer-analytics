<p><em>Pacific Gem</em> is a distinctive hop variety originating from New Zealand, developed by the New Zealand Horticultural Research Centre. This unique hop is a triploid cross between the New Zealand Smoothcone variety, a selected California Late <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/cluster/">Cluster</a> and <a href="/hops/aroma/fuggle/">Fuggle</a> hybrid. Released in 1987, <em>Pacific Gem</em> has quickly gained a reputation among homebrewers and professional brewers alike for its strong bittering properties, versatile flavor profile, and aromatic characteristics.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Pacific Gem</em> hops is characterized by a delightful combination of sweet, fruity notes reminiscent of blackberries and a subtle hint of oak, which imparts a pleasant woodiness to the beer. Its high alpha acid content, typically ranging between 13-16%, makes it an excellent choice for bittering applications in various beer styles. <em>Pacific Gem</em> is particularly well-suited for brewing English-style ales, porters, and stouts, where its unique flavor and aroma can truly shine. However, it is also versatile enough to be used in <a href="/styles/ipa/american-ipa/">American IPAs</a>, lagers, and even some Belgian-style beers. As a homebrewer, experimenting with <em>Pacific Gem</em> hops can add depth and complexity to your beer, setting it apart from more traditional hop varieties.</p>
