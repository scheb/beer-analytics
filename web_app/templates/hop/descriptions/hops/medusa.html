<p><em>Medusa</em> hops, also known as <em>Multihead</em> hops, are a unique variety of hops in the Neomexicanus subspecies native to Colorado and New Mexico. They are named after their multiheaded cones and are exclusively grown by CLS Farms in Yakima, Washington. Unlike the traditional European hops, <em>Medusa</em> hops belong to a different species, Humulus lupulus neomexicanus. These hops have gained attention in recent years thanks to their intense flavor profile and the efforts of independent plant researcher Todd Bates.</p>

<p><em>Medusa</em> hops offer a distinctive flavor profile with intense notes of guava, melon, apricot, and citrus fruit. They have low alpha acid levels, making them ideal for use as an aroma hop in beer brewing. <em>Medusa</em> hops are commonly used in <a href="/styles/ipa/american-ipa/">American IPA</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Imperial IPA</a>, <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ale</a>, American Wheat, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saison</a>, and Golden Ale styles. They provide a mellow bitterness with a citrusy bite when used early in the boil, while their aroma and flavor truly shine, offering fruity and alfalfa-like characteristics.</p>
