<p><em>Topaz</em> hops, a product of Australian breeding, were originally selected as a high alpha-acid hop for the production of extract. The hop was bred from an existing Australian high alpha acid variety crossed with pollen from a Wye college male. It was created by the Hop Products Australia (HPA) breeding program in 1985 and commercialized in 1997. However, it did not find popularity until 2011. <em>Topaz</em> hops are now recognized for their excellent flavor potential and are used in various beer styles including Amber Ale, APA, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPA</a>, and Session Ale.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Topaz</em> hops is quite unique and versatile. When added early in the brewing process, they impart resinous, grassy flavors. However, when added late in larger doses, they provide lychee and light tropical fruit flavors. Some sources also note the presence of clove-like spice, resinous grassy tones, and pine. This hop variety combines the characteristic earthy notes of traditional English varieties with fruit aromas of blackberry, gooseberry, blueberry, black currant, and passion fruit, rounded off with resinous and grapefruit notes. This makes <em>Topaz</em> a fantastic hop to use when dry hopping, and in higher gravity brews, specific flavor qualities come out as pleasant, and more pronounced light tropical fruit.</p>
