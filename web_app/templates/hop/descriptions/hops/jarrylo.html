<p><em>Jarrylo</em> hops, named after the Slavic god of fertility and springtime, Jarilo, are a unique variety bred by the American Dwarf Hop Association. The parentage of <em>Jarrylo</em> includes <a href="/hops/bittering/summit/">Summit</a> and other ADHA varieties. This hop variety is known for its strong fruit aromatics and is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process. However, its large oil fraction, particularly humulene and myrcene, and unique aromatics make it very well-suited to late, whirlpool, or dry hop additions. It is a good choice for pales and <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, and other hop-forward Belgian styles.</p>

<p><em>Jarrylo</em> hops have aroma descriptors that include strong lemon lime, orange, pear, banana, and mild spice. Some reviewers also notice a clean bright white wine aroma. Despite being marketed as a non-IPA hop, it has found its place in the brewing of <a href="/styles/ipa/">IPAs</a>, where it contributes complex fruit flavors. However, when used on its own, <em>Jarrylo</em> tends to work better in lighter or crisper beer styles, where the hop profile isnâ€™t quite so urgent and conspicuous.</p>
