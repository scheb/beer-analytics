<p><em>Taiheke</em> hops are a dual-purpose hop variety grown in New Zealand, but their origins are deeply rooted in the United States. The hop was first bred in the US in 1956, and it was commercially released by the USDA-ARS in 1972. The genetic makeup of <em>Taiheke</em> hops includes English <a href="/hops/aroma/fuggle/">Fuggle</a> and a male derived from the Russian variety <a href="/hops/aroma/serebrianka/">Serebrianka</a>. Over time, through selection, agronomics, and the influence of the New Zealand &quot;terroir&quot;, the flavor and aroma characteristics of <em>Taiheke</em> have evolved significantly from the original cultivar.

<em>Taiheke</em> hops are known for their remarkable levels of citrus notes that lean towards tropical fruit characteristics, such as grapefruit and lime. They perform well when used as a single variety across multiple kettle additions or when used for late addition or dry hopping. The hops can also be paired with other New Zealand aroma heavyweights like <a href="/hops/aroma/motueka/">Motueka</a> or <a href="/hops/aroma/riwaka/">Riwaka</a> to create unique flavor profiles. <em>Taiheke</em> hops are typically employed in &quot;new world&quot; style pale ales and are also suitable for very intense summer ales where their fruit-forward aroma and oil profile make for a refreshing finish.</p>
