<p><em>Pilgrim</em> hops, a product of the United Kingdom, were developed by Wye College and released in 2000. They are a half-sister to <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/first-gold/">First Gold</a>, sharing the same father, and their mother is from breeding lines derived from Wye <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/challenger/">Challenger</a> and Wye <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/target/">Target</a>. Despite having a dwarf hop in its lineage, <em>Pilgrim</em> is not a dwarf variety. It is known for its excellent resistance to wilt disease, often replacing &quot;Wye Target&quot; in areas where this disease is prevalent.</p>

<p><em>Pilgrim</em> hops are dual-purpose, meaning they can be used for both bittering and aroma in the brewing process. They are characterized by distinct fruit and spice characteristics, with pleasant lemon, grapefruit, pear, and berry flavors. They also bring a full-bodied, refreshing, and rounded bitterness to the beer, without being too overpowering. This makes them a versatile choice for brewers. In terms of aroma, <em>Pilgrim</em> hops offer an intense blend of aromatic herbs, sweet pineapple, creamy yogurt, vegetal artichoke, and ethereal lemon aromas, complemented by fine notes of chocolate and fruity strawberries. Particularly pronounced notes of aromatic marjoram, chili, fennel, and licorice complement the profile. They are a great choice for single-hopped beers due to their full-bodied bitterness and can complement the richness of darker beers just as well. They are commonly used in <a href="/styles/british-bitter/strong-bitter/">English Pale Ale</a>, Nut <a href="/styles/brown-british-beer/british-brown-ale/">Brown Ale</a>, and Stout, among other beer styles.</p>
