<p><em>Sultana</em> hops, also known as <em>Denali</em>, is a relatively new hop variety that has quickly gained popularity among brewers. It was first crossed in 2006 by the Hopsteiner Breeding Program and is a cross of 50% <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/nugget/">Nugget</a>, 25% <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/columbus/">Zeus</a>, and 25% USDA 19058m. The hop was released for commercial use in 2016 and renamed <em>Sultana</em> in 2019. The name <em>Sultana</em> was inspired by one of the largest peaks in the Alaskan Range, reflecting the big and bold characteristics of this hop variety.</p>

<p><em>Sultana</em> hops are known for their large cones, high oil content, and unique aroma. They are characterized by a pronounced pineapple, pine, and citrus flavor profile, with some brewers also noting a subtle hint of pine and a spicy undertone. The hop's heritage contributes to its great aroma characteristics and resistance against disease. <em>Sultana</em> is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process, making it a versatile choice for homebrewers. It's particularly well-suited for brewing <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> due to its high alpha acid content, ranging from 13.0 to 15.0%.</p>
