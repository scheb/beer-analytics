<p><em>Millennium</em> hops, named to mark the turn of the millennium, were released in the year 2000. They were bred in the John I. Haas, Inc., breeding program and are a high alpha acids variety. This hop is a daughter of <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/nugget/">Nugget</a>, and it shares a similar brewing profile with Nugget and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/columbus/">Columbus</a>, being primarily used as a bittering hop due to its strong alpha potential. However, <em>Millennium</em> hops are not just about bitterness. They have a unique aroma profile that includes resin, floral, toffee, and pear, which can add a complex layer of flavors to your brew.</p>

<p><em>Millennium</em> hops are often used in American Ales, Barleywines, and Stouts, where their high alpha acid content can balance out the malt sweetness. They are also known for their cream-caramel flavors of yogurt and toffee, subtly complemented by woody notes of tobacco. Spicy nuances of sage and curry as well as fruity red berry components also contribute to the <em>Millennium</em> hopâ€™s flavor profile. Despite their high alpha acid content, <em>Millennium</em> hops are considered mild in character, with an ability to impart herbaceous notes and elements of resin.</p>
