<p><em>Whitbread <a href="/hops/aroma/golding/">Golding</a> Variety (WGV)</em> hops, first selected in 1911 by hop grower Edward Albert White, are a result of open pollinated <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/bates-brewer/">Bate's Brewer</a>. The hop's current name was coined after the Whitbread Brewing Company acquired the farm on which it was raised. Officially released for production in 1953, <em>WGV</em> was hailed as a savior variety by growers in Kent in the 1950s due to its resistance to Verticillium Wilt, a disease that had devastated Golding and <a href="/hops/aroma/fuggle/">Fuggle</a> crops in the region.</p>

<p><em>WGV</em> is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process. It has a robust and slightly sweet, hoppy flavor, with fragrantly woodsy overtones of fresh garden herbs and green fruit. The hop's aroma profile is described as thick creamy caramel, <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> almond, tea-like overtones, and woody-aromatic bergamot. Sweet notes also play a key role, including honeydew melon, fig, dried fruit, and nuances of Almdudler (herbal lemonade) and port lightly underscored by a spicy liquorice aroma. It's commonly used in brewing <a href="/styles/scottish-ale/">Scottish Ale</a>, Bitter, Pale Ale, Marzen, and Amber Ale.</p>
