<p><em>Vic Secret</em> is a hop variety that was developed in Australia and is known for its unique flavor and aroma profile. It is a relatively new hop variety that was first released in 2010 by the Hop Products Australia (HPA) breeding program, and has since gained popularity among craft brewers worldwide. Like her sister <a href="/hops/aroma/topaz/">Topaz</a>, she is the result of crossing an Australian high alpha variety and a male variety from the UK.</p>

<p><em>Vic Secret</em> hops are characterized by their strong tropical fruit and pine aroma, with distinct notes of pineapple, passionfruit, and citrus. They also have a high alpha acid content, which makes them well-suited for use in both bittering and aroma additions in brewing. Their flavor profile has been described as complex, with a balance of sweetness and bitterness, making them a versatile hop for a range of beer styles.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Vic Secret</em> hops are a great addition to any brewer's toolkit, particularly for those looking to experiment with unique and bold flavors in their beer.</p>
