<p><em>Summer</em> hops, sometimes referred to as AU Summer hops, originate from Australia and were bred by Hop Products Australia (HPA) in 1997. They are the result of open pollination of a tetraploid Czech <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a> at the Tasmanian Bushy Park Breeding Garden. This variety was one of HPA's first successes in attempting to breed a true aroma hop by European standards. With its low alpha acids, <em>Summer</em> hops can be used generously in brewing without making the beer overly <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a>. The hop profile truly reveals itself when used for dry hopping, providing excellent results in the beer.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Summer</em> hops is quite unique and interesting. They are known for their delicate and sublime notes of apricot and melon, with some even noting elements of grass, peach, passionfruit, and citrus. These hops are not as spicy as their Czech parent, Saaz. They are typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping, and are particularly well-suited to a range of American ales, especially <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>.</p>
