<p><em>Kohatu</em> hops, a dual-purpose variety, were developed by the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research and released in 2011. The hop is a triploid aroma type, produced through the crossing of a Hallertau Mittlefruh and a New Zealand Male with North American and European parentage. <em>Kohatu</em> hops are known for their fresh tropical fruit characters and excellent finish and bitterness. This hop variety is versatile and can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing </p>

<p><em>Kohatu</em> hops have a unique blend of subtle tropical fruit and pine aromatics. They are described as having an intense fresh tropical fruit character, with bright lime and pineapple notes, traces of pine, and a pleasant, rounded bitterness. This hop variety works really well in single hop applications, showcasing its fruity aroma characters balanced by the extraordinary quality of bitterness. Higher addition rates can pack a fruit-driven punch in bigger beer styles. The hop is ideal for use in <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, dry-hopped sours, and <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/blonde-ale/">blonde ales</a> or lagers.</p>
