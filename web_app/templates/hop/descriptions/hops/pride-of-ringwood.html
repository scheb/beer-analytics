<p><em>Pride of Ringwood</em> is a distinctive Australian hop, developed in 1953 at the Carlton and United Breweries' research facility in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood. This hop was bred from the English variety <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/pride-of-kent/">Pride of Kent</a> through open pollination, making it a unique hop developed by one brewery and predominantly used by that brewery. At the time of its release in 1965, it had the highest alpha acid content in the world, making it a highly sought-after bittering hop.</p>

<p><em>Pride of Ringwood</em> is known for its pronounced yet pleasant aroma, which includes woody, earthy, herbal, cedar, and oak notes. It's primarily used as a bittering hop, but it can also exhibit spicy, fruity aromas when used as a late addition. This hop is especially suited to Australian lagers, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/australian-sparkling-ale/">Australian Sparkling Ale</a>, and other beer styles like Amber Ale, Lager, Fruit <a href="/hops/aroma/lambic/">Lambic</a>, Pale Ale, <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">Strong Ale</a>, and Golden Ale. It's worth noting that <em>Pride of Ringwood</em> does not have a long shelf life, but it's highly resistant to diseases and has little inter-annual variation.</p>
