<p><em>Zythos</em> is a proprietary hop blend created by Hopunion, a company based in the United States. It was designed to optimize and exceed the aroma characteristics of traditional <a href="/styles/ipa/">IPA</a> hops, which can sometimes be difficult to obtain. The blend was created by a team of professional hop sniffers, and the result is a unique aroma and flavor profile that is more than the sum of its individual parts.</p>

<p><em>Zythos</em> is a dual-purpose hop, meaning it can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process. It imparts distinct tangerine, citrus, floral, pine, and grapefruit tones to the beer. The flavor profile is complex and well-rounded, with a focus on citrus, tropical, pine, and spicy notes, in that order. Some experimental varieties are also included in the blend to add complexity. This hop blend is perfect for West Coast style hoppy Pale Ales and <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, but its versatility means it can be used creatively in a variety of beer styles. If <em>Zythos</em> hops are hard to find, they can be substituted with <a href="/hops/aroma/amarillo/">Amarillo</a> or <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/simcoe/">Simcoe</a> hops. However, each hop variety has its own unique characteristics, so substitutions may alter the flavor profile of your beer.</p>
