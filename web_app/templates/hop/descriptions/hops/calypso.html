<p><em>Calypso</em> hops, a relatively new addition to the world of brewing, were first developed by the Hop Breeding Company in Washington State, United States. This unique hop variety was patent and first released in 2012, after years of research and crossbreeding. It is a dual-purpose hop, meaning it can be used both for bittering and aroma. <em>Calypso</em> hops are a result of a cross of Hopsteiner breeding hops, one derived from <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/nugget/">Nugget</a>, making them a distinct and exciting option for homebrewers to experiment with.</p>

<p>The <em>Calypso</em> hop is known for its complex flavor profile, featuring fruity and citrus notes, with a touch of earthy and herbal undertones. Prominent flavors include apple, pear, and hints of stone fruit, as well as a mild spiciness. The high alpha acid content, typically ranging from 12% to 14%, makes <em>Calypso</em> hops an excellent choice for bittering, while their robust aroma profile lends itself to late additions and dry hopping. These hops are well-suited for a variety of beer styles, such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, pale ales, and even stouts or porters, where their fruity and citrus character can complement the beer's overall flavor.</p>

<p>Incorporating <em>Calypso</em> hops into your recipes can elevate your beer to new heights. Experiment with this versatile hop in single-hop brews or combine it with other hop varieties to create a unique and captivating blend. No matter your brewing style, <em>Calypso</em> hops can offer a refreshing twist to your creations, resulting in a memorable and enjoyable experience for you and your fellow beer enthusiasts.</p>
