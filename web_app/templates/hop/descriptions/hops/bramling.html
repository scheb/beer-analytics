<p>Bramling hops, popular in England around the turn of the 20th century, were extensively used in golden and rye ales. Despite their origin being unknown, they were widely cultivated by 1865. However, due to their increasingly low yield, they have fallen out of favor over time. Today, they are grown in British <a href="/hops/aroma/columbia/">Columbia</a>, catering to Canadian breweries that desire aroma hops.</p>

<p>Bramling hops are characterized by their very low alpha acids, around 5.8%, and moderately low cohumulone, approximately 27%. This combination results in a pleasant European aroma, making them an ideal choice for beers where a more pronounced aroma is desired. Their flavor profile is quite distinctive, with notes of lemon, blackcurrant, blackberries, and plums, especially when used as a late addition in the brewing process. These hops are particularly suited to all English beer styles, including golden ale, <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a>, rye ale, <a href="/styles/ipa/">India pale ale</a>, stout, and holiday ale.</p>
