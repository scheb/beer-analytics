<p><em>Pekko</em> hops, named after the Finnish God of Field and Crops, are a unique variety bred by the American Dwarf Hop Association. This dual-purpose hop is known for its high alpha acid and an intriguing mix of flavors. <em>Pekko</em>'s lineage includes an open pollinated male with ADHA 538 as the female, and it is cultivated in the United States. The <em>Pekko</em> hop is an intriguing mix of flavors like mint, pear, citrus, cucumber, and floral aspects. Its complex and clean characteristics of floral, citrus, and mint lend itself to many styles of beer.</p>

<p><em>Pekko</em> hops are known for their fresh lemon and lime flavors, but what makes them unique are the floral and herbal elements that some brewers describe as cucumber, mint, and sage. There are undertones of pineapple and pears, but they are not the main attraction here. <em>Pekko</em> hops can really excel in styles like <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saison</a>, <a href="/styles/historical-beer/gose/">gose</a>, or even a non-traditional pilsner. They also offer good bittering potential, making them a versatile choice for homebrewers.</p>
