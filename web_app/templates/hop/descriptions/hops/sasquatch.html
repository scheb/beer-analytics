<p><em>Sasquatch</em> is a proprietary hop strain developed from a wild Canadian variety that was first found in Pemberton, British <a href="/hops/aroma/columbia/">Columbia</a>. It was first released to the public in 2018. This hop strain is named after the mythical Sasquatch creature, which is said to roam the forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p><em>Sasquatch</em> hops are known for their complex flavor and aroma characteristics, which include notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, and earthy spice. They also have a relatively high alpha acid content, which makes them suitable for use in both bittering and aroma additions. <em>Sasquatch</em> hops are often used in hop-forward beer styles, such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, pale ales, and <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">double IPAs</a>, to add a distinctive aroma and flavor profile to the beer. Due to their popularity and limited availability, <em>Sasquatch</em> hops can be quite expensive and may be difficult to find outside of certain regions.</p>
