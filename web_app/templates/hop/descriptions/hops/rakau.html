<p><em>Rakau</em> hops, a dual-purpose variety, were released in 2007 from the New Zealand hop breeding program. This hop variety is often described as "the whole orchard" due to its unique aroma profile. <em>Rakau</em> hops are characterized by high-intensity aromas of ripe stone fruits, particularly apricot, and pine. They also exhibit tropical fruit and candy-like notes. The alpha acid range of <em>Rakau</em> hops is between 9.0% and 11.0%, and they have a co-humulone content of 23-25%. The total oil content ranges from 1.8 to 2.2 mL/100g, with myrcene being a significant component.</p>

<p><em>Rakau</em> hops are well-suited for brewing "hoppy not <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a>" <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, hop-forward lagers, <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>, and highly aromatic American wheats. They perform best when used in combination with late additions and dry hopping, contributing to a brash fruity character and well-constructed bitterness. The flavor profile of <em>Rakau</em> hops includes stone fruit, fig, fruity, apricot, pine, and resin characteristics. They are often used in New World styles, and their unique flavor and aroma profiles make them a popular choice for homebrewers.</p>
