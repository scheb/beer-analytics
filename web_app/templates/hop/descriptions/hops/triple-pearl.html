<p><em>Triple Pearl</em> hops, a relatively new variety to the brewing scene, were developed by crossing the popular <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/perle/">Perle</a> hop with a unique, proprietary hop variety. Born in the United States, this versatile hop owes its roots to the USDA-ARS Hop Breeding and Genetics Program and was first released publicly in 2013. While <em>Triple Pearl</em> hops share similarities with their parent Perle hops, they bring a unique and distinct flavor profile to the table, which has captured the interest of craft brewers and homebrewers alike.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Triple Pearl</em> hops is characterized by a well-balanced mix of floral, fruity, and spicy notes, accompanied by a moderate to high alpha acid content (ranging from 10.5% to 13.5%). This delightful combination makes it an excellent choice for a variety of beer styles, from <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> and Pale Ales to Lagers and Pilsners. In brewing, <em>Triple Pearl</em> hops can be used both for bittering and aroma, providing a clean and smooth bitterness with a lingering, complex aroma. As a homebrewer, experimenting with <em>Triple Pearl</em> hops will undoubtedly add a fresh, nuanced dimension to your beer, imparting flavors that are at once familiar yet delightfully new.</p>
