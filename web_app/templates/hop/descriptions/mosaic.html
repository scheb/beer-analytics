<p><em>Mosaic</em> hops, first introduced in 2012 by the Hop Breeding Company, are the result of a cross between Simcoe and Nugget hops. These relatively new hops quickly gained popularity among craft brewers and homebrewers alike, thanks to their versatile and unique flavor profile.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of Mosaic hops is distinctive and complex, boasting a wide range of tropical fruit, citrus, and floral notes, as well as some earthy, piney undertones. Key flavor components include mango, blueberry, tangerine, and papaya, with hints of rose and bubblegum. This makes Mosaic hops a popular choice for hop-forward beer styles such as IPAs, pale ales, and New England IPAs, where their unique flavor and aroma contributions can truly shine. Additionally, Mosaic hops can be utilized in both the early stages of the brewing process for bittering, as well as in the later stages for flavor and aroma.

Whether you're brewing a classic IPA or crafting an adventurous new beer style, Mosaic hops are sure to deliver a unique and enjoyable taste experience.</p>
