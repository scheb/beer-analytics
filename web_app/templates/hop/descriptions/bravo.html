These hops were bred as a response to the increasing demand for high alpha acid hops, which are known for their excellent bittering properties. <em>Bravo</em> hops are a versatile and popular choice among homebrewers and professional brewers alike. They originate from the United States and are a cross between Zeus and a male US variety, inheriting the best qualities of both parent varieties. <em>Bravo</em> hops are known for their impressive yield and resistance to diseases, making them an attractive choice for hop farmers.</p>

<p>The <em>Bravo</em> hop variety boasts a complex flavor profile, characterized by its bold, earthy aroma with subtle hints of sweet fruits and floral undertones. The alpha acid content typically ranges between 14-17%, contributing to a clean and smooth bitterness when used in beer brewing. Due to their high alpha acid content, <em>Bravo</em> hops are primarily utilized as a bittering agent in various beer styles, including IPAs, stouts, and American pale ales.

Overall, <em>Bravo</em> hops are a versatile and valuable addition to any homebrewer's hop arsenal, offering both excellent bittering properties and a distinct, complementary flavor.</p>
