<p>Bittering hops are a type of hop variety used in beer brewing to impart bitterness, balance, and counteract the sweetness of malt sugars. They typically have high levels of alpha acids, the compounds responsible for bitterness in beer. These hops are added early in the boiling process, allowing the alpha acids to isomerize and dissolve into the wort, providing the desired <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> flavor.</p>

<p>During the brewing process, bittering hops are usually added to the boiling wort for 60 to 90 minutes. This lengthy boil time allows the alpha acids to be extracted and converted into iso-alpha acids, which create the stable bitterness that characterizes many beer styles, particularly <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> and Pale Ales. Bittering hops not only contribute to the overall flavor profile of the beer but also aid in its preservation by imparting antimicrobial properties. In summary, bittering hops play a crucial role in creating a balanced and enjoyable beer, while also contributing to its stability and shelf-life.</p>
