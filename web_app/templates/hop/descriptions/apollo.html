<p><em>Apollo</em> hops are a relatively recent addition to the world of hops, first developed and released in 2006 by the Hopsteiner Breeding Program in the United States. This high alpha acid hop is a product of a crossbreeding between the popular Zeus and other unnamed USDA varieties, which has resulted in a powerful, dual-purpose hop that has gained traction among both commercial and homebrewers alike. <em>Apollo</em> hops are known for their impressive resistance to diseases and pests, which makes them an attractive choice for growers.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Apollo</em> hops is characterized by a strong, assertive bitterness with distinct resinous and earthy tones, accompanied by subtle notes of citrus, grapefruit, and pine. Due to their high alpha acid content, which typically ranges between 15-19%, <em>Apollo</em> hops are an excellent choice for brewers looking to impart a solid bitterness backbone to their beers. This hop variety is particularly well-suited for American-style IPAs, Pale Ales, and even Stouts, where its robust bitterness can balance out the sweetness of malt-forward brews. When used as a late addition or for dry hopping, <em>Apollo</em> hops can also contribute a pleasant aroma that complements a wide range of beer styles. As a homebrewer, experimenting with <em>Apollo</em> hops can add a unique and bold character to your beers, setting them apart from the rest.</p>
