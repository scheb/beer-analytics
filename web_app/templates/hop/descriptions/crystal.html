<p><em>Crystal</em> hops are a versatile American hop variety that has gained popularity among homebrewers for their distinct aromatic and flavor properties. These hops were developed in 1983 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a result of triploid crossing from Hallertau Mittelfr√ºh, Cascade, Brewer's Gold and Early Green. This unique lineage lends <em>Crystal</em> hops their characteristic blend of European and American hop traits, making them a favorite among craft brewers and homebrewers alike.</p>

<p><em>Crystal</em> hops are prized for their moderate alpha acid content (typically ranging between 3.5% and 5.5%) and their delicate, yet complex, aroma and flavor profile. The flavor and aroma imparted by <em>Crystal</em> hops can be described as a mix of floral, spicy, and herbal notes with subtle hints of citrus and earthy undertones. This hop variety is particularly suitable for use in a wide range of beer styles, from traditional German lagers and pilsners to American pale ales and IPAs. Homebrewers appreciate the versatility of <em>Crystal</em> hops, as they can be used for both bittering and aroma additions throughout the brewing process. In particular, the delicate balance between bitterness and aroma makes these hops an excellent choice for late-boil, whirlpool, or dry hopping additions, adding a refined and complex character to your homemade brews.</p>
