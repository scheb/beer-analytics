Being the result of open pollination of a wild hop that was sourced from Morden, Manitoba, <em>Brewer's Gold</em> boasts a distinctive pedigree that has contributed to its lasting appeal. Despite its English origins, this hop has also gained popularity in other beer-producing countries, such as Germany and the United States, where it has been used to create various regional brews.</p>

<p><em>Brewer's Gold</em> hops are known for their robust and unique flavor profile, which is characterized by a mix of spicy, fruity, and earthy notes.

This makes them a versatile choice for a wide range of styles, such as English ales, stouts, porters, and even certain lagers. In addition to providing bitterness, <em>Brewer's Gold</em> hops also impart a distinct aroma that combines black currant, fruit, and spicy notes. As a homebrewer, you can experiment with <em>Brewer's Gold</em> in your recipes to create bold and flavorsome brews that showcase the unique characteristics of this hop variety.</p>
