<p><em>Citra</em> hops are developed by the <a href="https://www.hopbreeding.com/">Hop Breeding Company</a> from crossing Hallertauer Mittelfrueh and a father derived from U.S. Tettnang. They were first released in 2008 and are typically used as a dual-purpose hop, meaning they can be used for both bittering and aroma in beer production.</p>

<p><em>Citra</em> hops owe their name to the distinct, fruit-forward citrus characteristics they bring to the table. The flavor profile is characterized by strong citrus notes, featuring grapefruit, lime, and orange, as well as tropical fruit undertones such as mango, passionfruit, and lychee. These intense fruit flavors are complemented by subtle hints of fresh herbs and pine, making <em>Citra</em> hops an ideal choice for adding a burst of aroma and flavor to a wide range of beer styles. With a typical alpha acid content of 11-15%, <em>Citra</em> hops are versatile enough for bittering, flavor, and aroma additions during the brewing process.</p>p>

<p><em>Citra</em> hops have gained immense popularity among homebrewers and commercial breweries alike, particularly in American Pale Ales, India Pale Ales (IPAs), and Double IPAs. The hop's ability to impart a bold, fruity flavor and aroma makes it a standout choice for late kettle additions, whirlpooling, and dry hopping. For homebrewers looking to experiment with <em>Citra</em> hops, consider using them in conjunction with other hop varieties to create a unique, multi-layered hop character, or let them shine as a single-hop showcase in your next brew. The distinctive, fruit-forward profile of <em>Citra</em> hops is guaranteed to elevate your beer and provide an unforgettable tasting experience.</p>
