<p>Floral notes contribute a distinct bouquet of flower-like scents to a beer's aroma and flavor. These are primarily derived from essential oils present in hops, particularly compounds such as geraniol. When added during the brewing process, hops with a high concentration of these oils can impart a delicate, fresh, and often subtly sweet character to the beer. Floral notes are commonly associated with traditional European hop varieties and can be found in styles such as Pilsners, English Ales, and <a href="/styles/trappist-ale/belgian-tripel/">Belgian Tripels</a>.</p>
