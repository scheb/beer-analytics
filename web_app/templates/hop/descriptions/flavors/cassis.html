<p>Cassis flavor, which is derived from black currants, is considered desirable in certain beer styles where fruity, tangy, and slightly sweet notes are appreciated. These styles include <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/fruit-lambic/">Fruit Lambics</a>, <a href="/styles/fruit-beer-variants/fruit-beer/">Fruit Beers</a>, and some Sour Ales. Fruit <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/lambic/">Lambics</a>, such as Kriek or Framboise, are Belgian beers that incorporate fruit during fermentation, lending a distinct fruit character and a balanced tartness. Similarly, Fruit Beers often showcase various fruit flavors by incorporating real fruits or fruit extracts, making cassis a welcome addition to the flavor profile. Finally, Sour Ales like <a href="/styles/american-wild-ale/">American Wild Ales</a> and <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/berliner-weisse/">Berliner Weisse</a> can also benefit from the addition of cassis, as its rich, tangy flavor complements the beer's natural acidity and sourness, resulting in a complex and refreshing drinking experience.</p>
