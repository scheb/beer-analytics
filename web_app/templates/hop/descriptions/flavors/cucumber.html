<p>Cucumber flavor is a unique and refreshing addition to many beer styles. It adds a light and crisp taste that can be found in both ales and lagers. Cucumber hops are most desirable in lighter beers such as pale ales, pilsners, wheat beers, and saisons.

This makes it a great choice for those looking to add a unique twist to their brews.</p>
