<p>Marjoram is an herb with a unique flavor profile, combining sweet, floral, and slightly citrusy notes. When incorporated into beer hops, marjoram imparts a subtle yet delightful twist to the brew. This herbaceous flavor is particularly desirable in beer styles where delicate, floral, and herbal characteristics are appreciated, such as saisons, Belgian witbiers, and certain pale ales. The addition of marjoram can enhance the overall complexity and depth of these styles, making them stand out to craft beer enthusiasts seeking new and exciting flavor experiences.</p>
