<p>Hops with a peppery flavor are often associated with the noble hop varieties, such as Hallertau, <a href="/hops/aroma/tettnanger/">Tettnanger</a>, and Spalt. These hops are known for their spicy, earthy, and herbal notes, and are commonly used in German and Czech beer styles, such as pilsners, lagers, and wheat beers. In these styles, the hops provide a subtle, but distinct, peppery kick that complements the beer's clean, crisp character. Additionally, some American and English-style pale ales and <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> may also benefit from the use of these hops, as they can provide a unique twist to the beer's hop profile, adding a touch of complexity to the overall flavor profile. Ultimately, the use of hops with a peppery flavor will depend on the brewer's desired taste and the beer style they are aiming to create.</p>
