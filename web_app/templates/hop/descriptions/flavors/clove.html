<p>Clove flavors in beer are often desirable in certain traditional European beer styles that embrace complex and spicy characteristics. These styles include Belgian <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">Witbier</a>, German Hefeweizen, and <a href="/styles/trappist-ale/belgian-dubbel/">Belgian Dubbel</a>, among others.
