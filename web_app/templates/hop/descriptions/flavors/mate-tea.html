<p>Mate tea flavor is often associated with certain hop varieties that bring a distinct herbal, earthy, and slightly grassy quality to beer. The flavor is generally favorable in beer styles where complex herbal and earthy notes can enhance the overall tasting profile, and where these flavors can be balanced by the malt backbone or other hop characteristics.</p>

<p>In particular, it shines in traditional and craft versions of English-style ales, like ESBs (Extra <a href="/styles/british-bitter/best-bitter/">Special Bitters</a>) and Pale Ales, which are known for their balanced hop and malt profiles, with the hops contributing a wide range of flavors from fruity to herbal. The flavor also works well in Belgian and French styles like <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>, where the rustic, earthy qualities of the style can be complemented by the mate tea flavor. Similarly, it can be a pleasant addition to certain types of Lagers, particularly those leaning towards the maltier side, like <a href="/styles/amber-malty-european-lager/maerzen/">MÃ¤rzens</a> and Bocks, where the beer's inherent sweet and bready character can be juxtaposed with the tea-like, herbal hop flavor. In the realm of experimentation, craft brewers may find the mate tea flavor intriguing for developing unique <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPA</a> or Farmhouse Ale renditions. As with all brewing decisions, the desired final product, balance, and complementary flavors guide the choice of hop variety and the resulting flavors.</p>
