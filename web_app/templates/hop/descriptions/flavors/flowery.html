<p>Flowery flavor is a desirable characteristic in many beer styles, such as IPAs, pale ales, and wheat beers. It is created by the presence of certain hop varieties that impart floral notes to the aroma and flavor of the beer. These hops are typically used during the dry-hopping process, which is when hops are added after fermentation has finished. The flowery flavor imparted by these hops can range from subtle to intense, depending on the variety used and how much is added. This flavor profile can add complexity to a beer and make it more enjoyable for drinkers.</p>
