<p>Vanilla notes are subtle flavors that can enhance a brew's complexity and overall drinking experience. These notes are most desirable in beer styles that benefit from the warm, smooth, and slightly sweet character of vanilla, such as porters, stouts, and certain <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>.
