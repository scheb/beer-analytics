<p>Musty flavor is a characteristic of certain hop varieties and is often described as having a damp, earthy, or moldy taste. This flavor can be desirable in some styles of beer, such as Belgian ales, English porters and stouts, German lagers, and American wheat beers. Musty flavors can also come from aging beer on wood, which can add complexity to the flavor profile. While musty flavors are not always desirable in all beer styles, they can be used to create unique and interesting flavors.</p>
