<p>Tangerine flavor is particularly desirable in fruit-forward and citrusy beer styles, as it complements and enhances the overall flavor profile. Some of the most popular styles where tangerine notes are appreciated include American Pale Ales, India Pale Ales (especially New England and West Coast styles), and fruited Wheat Ales. These styles often incorporate hop varieties that impart a natural citrus character, and the addition of tangerine further accentuates the refreshing, zesty qualities that many beer enthusiasts enjoy. Additionally, tangerine can also be a welcome addition to certain sour and Belgian styles, such as Goses, Berliner Weisses, and Witbiers, where the fruity notes provide a delightful contrast to the tart or spicy elements present in these beers. Ultimately, the tangerine flavor adds a lively and invigorating dimension that elevates the overall drinking experience.</p>
