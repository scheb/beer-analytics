<p>Tangerine flavor is particularly desirable in fruit-forward and citrusy beer styles, as it complements and enhances the overall flavor profile. Some of the most popular styles where tangerine notes are appreciated include <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/ipa/">India Pale Ales</a> (especially New England and West Coast styles), and fruited Wheat Ales.
