<p>Mandarin notes refer to the distinct citrus flavors, specifically tangerine or mandarin orange, imparted by certain hop varieties in beer. These notes are desirable in beer styles where fruity, citrus characteristics complement the overall profile, such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, Pale Ales, and American Wheat Ales. Hops like <a href="/hops/aroma/mandarina-bavaria/">Mandarina Bavaria</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/citra/">Citra</a>, and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/mosaic/">Mosaic</a> are known to contribute these mandarin qualities.
