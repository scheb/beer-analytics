<p>The &quot;smooth&quot; descriptor refers to a mellow, balanced hop character without harsh bitterness. It's often associated with hops that contribute a blend of floral, earthy, and subtle citrus flavors. Smooth hops are desirable in beer styles that aim for balance over pronounced hoppiness, such as English Ales, <a href="/styles/brown-british-beer/british-brown-ale/">Brown Ales</a>, and some Lagers.
