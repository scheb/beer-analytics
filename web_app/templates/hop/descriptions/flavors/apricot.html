<p>Apricot flavor is particularly desirable in fruit-forward beer styles, as it imparts a unique, refreshing taste that pairs well with the base beer. Styles such as <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/fruit-lambic/">fruit lambics</a>, <a href="/styles/fruit-beer-variants/fruit-beer/">fruit beers</a>, and <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/berliner-weisse/">Berliner Weisse</a> often incorporate apricot to enhance their fruity, tangy characteristics. Additionally, apricot can be an appealing flavor in some American wheat ales and <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, where its natural sweetness and tartness complement the beer's light body and effervescence. The addition of apricot in these styles results in a delightful, aromatic beer with a pleasant balance between sweet and sour notes, making it a popular choice for those seeking a fruit-infused, thirst-quenching brew.</p>
