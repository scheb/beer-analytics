<p>Lime is a citrus fruit that can add a refreshing and tangy flavor to beer. It is a popular addition to certain beer styles, particularly those that are light and crisp in flavor. For example, Mexican-style lagers, such as Corona or Modelo, often feature a wedge of lime on the bottle or in the glass, which can enhance their light, crisp character. Similarly, some wheat beers, such as Belgian <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">Witbiers</a>, can benefit from a hint of lime, which can complement their subtle spicy and fruity notes. Lime can also be added to sour beers, where its acidity can blend well with the tartness of the beer. However, it is important to note that lime is not a desirable addition to all beer styles, and should be used with discretion to avoid overpowering the other flavors in the beer.</p>
