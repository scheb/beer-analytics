<p>Papaya notes are an enticing flavor profile resulting from the use of certain hop varieties, such as <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/citra/">Citra</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/galaxy/">Galaxy</a>, and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/mosaic/">Mosaic</a>. These tropical fruit characteristics are especially desirable in beer styles like India Pale Ales (<a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>), <a href="/styles/ipa/new-england-ipa/">New England IPAs</a> (NEIPAs), and <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a> (APAs). The sweet, juicy, and slightly tart papaya flavors complement the beer's bitterness and enhance its overall aroma and taste. The inclusion of papaya notes in these styles creates an inviting, fruity balance that appeals to both casual drinkers and craft beer enthusiasts.</p>
