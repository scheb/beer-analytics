<p>Green flavor is a desirable trait for many beer styles, such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, pale ales, and pilsners. It is a grassy and herbal taste that gives the beer a fresh and vibrant character. Green hop flavor is created by harvesting the hops while they are still green, unripe, and full of essential oils. This results in a more intense flavor that can be both <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> and sweet. Green hops also add an earthy aroma to the beer, which can be quite pleasant. In addition to adding flavor and aroma, green hops also help preserve the beerâ€™s freshness and provide a longer shelf life.</p>
