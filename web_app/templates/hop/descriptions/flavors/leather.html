<p>Leather flavor in beer is a complex, earthy characteristic often associated with aged or wild-fermented beers. This flavor profile is usually found in certain traditional beer styles such as <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/old-ale/">Old Ales</a>, Barleywines, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/flanders-red-ale/">Flanders Red Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/lambic/">Lambics</a>, and some <a href="/styles/trappist-ale/belgian-dubbel/">Belgian Dubbels</a>. It's created by the interaction of hops, malt, and yeast, particularly when aged or spontaneously fermented. The leather note can be desirable, as it adds depth and complexity, complementing other flavors like dark fruit, caramel, and oak, making these beers unique and enjoyable for discerning palates.</p>
