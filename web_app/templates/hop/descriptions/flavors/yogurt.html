<p>Yogurt flavor refers to a unique tangy, lactic acidity often derived from lactobacillus bacteria, which can enhance certain beer styles. This distinct taste profile is desirable in sour beers, such as Berliner Weisse and Gose, where the yogurt-like acidity adds depth and complexity to the overall flavor. It also complements fruity and herbal notes in these styles, creating a refreshing and palatable experience for the drinker. Brewers who value experimentation may also incorporate yogurt flavors in hop-forward styles, like IPAs, to add a twist to traditional recipes.</p>
