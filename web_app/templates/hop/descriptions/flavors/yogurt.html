<p>Yogurt flavor refers to a unique tangy, lactic acidity often derived from lactobacillus bacteria, which can enhance certain beer styles. This distinct taste profile is desirable in sour beers, such as <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/berliner-weisse/">Berliner Weisse</a> and <a href="/styles/historical-beer/gose/">Gose</a>, where the yogurt-like acidity adds depth and complexity to the overall flavor. It also complements fruity and herbal notes in these styles, creating a refreshing and palatable experience for the drinker. Brewers who value experimentation may also incorporate yogurt flavors in hop-forward styles, like <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, to add a twist to traditional recipes.</p>
