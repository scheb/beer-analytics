<p>&quot;Dank&quot; is a term often used to describe a specific aroma and flavor in beer resulting from certain types of hops. Characterized by resinous, earthy, and pungent qualities, this unique profile is often likened to the smell of cannabis. This descriptor is particularly desirable in hop-forward beer styles like India Pale Ales (IPAs), Double/Imperial IPAs, and American Pale Ales. The dankness can add depth to these beer styles, harmonizing with other hop characteristics like fruitiness or bitterness, to create a complex, multifaceted flavor profile.</p>
