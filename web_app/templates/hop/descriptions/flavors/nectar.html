<p>Nectar flavor is characterized by its sweet, floral, and fruity notes, which contribute to the overall aroma and taste profile of a beer. It is particularly desirable in beer styles such as <a href="/styles/ipa/new-england-ipa/">New England IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a>, and <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian Ales</a>, where the fruity, juicy, and tropical characteristics are key to their appeal. The nectar-like flavors blend harmoniously with the malt backbone, enhancing the complexity and depth of the beer while maintaining a balanced, refreshing finish. Brewers often use hops varieties like <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/citra/">Citra</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/mosaic/">Mosaic</a>, and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/galaxy/">Galaxy</a> to achieve this sought-after nectar flavor.</p>
