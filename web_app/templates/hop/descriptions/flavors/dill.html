<p>Dill is a unique flavor that can be found in some beer hops. It has a distinct herbal, grassy, and slightly spicy taste. It is most commonly used in American-style ales, such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> and pale ales, but can also be used in stouts and porters. Dill adds a complex flavor profile to beers, which can help to balance out the bitterness of the hops. It pairs well with other hop varieties, such as citrusy or floral hops, and can also be used to add an extra layer of complexity to a beer.</p>
