<p>Oregano is a flavor in hops, giving beers a unique herbal aroma and taste. It is most desirable in styles such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, pale ales, and Belgian-style ales. Oregano can be used to add a subtle earthy flavor to the beer, while also providing a slight bitterness that helps to balance out the sweetness of the malt. The herb can also be used to give beers a unique aroma that stands out from other styles. For those looking for something different in their beer, oregano hops may be just the ticket.</p>
