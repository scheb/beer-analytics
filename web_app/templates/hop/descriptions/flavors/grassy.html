<p>Hops with grassy flavor can add a fresh and herbaceous character to beer, which can be particularly desirable in certain beer styles. For example, in a classic German Pilsner, hops with a grassy flavor can complement the crisp and clean malt profile while providing a subtle bitterness. Additionally, grassy hops can work well in hop-forward styles like <a href="/styles/ipa/american-ipa/">American IPAs</a>, where the bright and zesty flavors can balance out the bold hop bitterness and juicy fruit notes. Other styles that may benefit from the grassy hop flavor include English <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">Bitters</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>, and <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/belgian-pale-ale/">Belgian Pale Ales</a>. However, the suitability of grassy hops will ultimately depend on the brewer's intended flavor profile, as well as the specific characteristics of the hop variety used.</p>
