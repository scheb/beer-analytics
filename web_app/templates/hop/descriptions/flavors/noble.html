These flavors are characterized by the delicate, floral, and spicy notes imparted by Noble hops, a group of traditional hop varieties including Hallertauer, Tettnanger, Spalt, and Saaz. Classic beer styles that benefit from Noble flavors include Pilsners, Helles, and Bocks, as well as Munich Dunkels and various Wheat Beers. These styles showcase a fine balance between malt sweetness and the subtle bitterness, earthiness, and herbal qualities of Noble hops.
