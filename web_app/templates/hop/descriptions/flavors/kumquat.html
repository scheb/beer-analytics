<p>Kumquat is a unique flavor that adds a tart, citrusy note to beer hops. It is desirable in a variety of beer styles, including IPAs, pale ales, and wheat beers. Kumquat can be used in both dry hopping and late hop additions to give the beer a bright, juicy flavor. It's also great for adding complexity to fruited sours and Belgian-style beers. Kumquat hops are ideal for creating balanced and refreshing beers with a distinct citrusy character.</p>
