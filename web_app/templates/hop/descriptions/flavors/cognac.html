These flavors can enhance strong, dark, and malty styles, such as Belgian Quadrupels, Barleywines, and <a href="/styles/american-porter-and-stout/imperial-stout/">Imperial Stouts</a>. In these styles, the Cognac notes can meld well with the inherent sweetness, dark fruit, and roasted malt flavors, creating a sumptuous and sophisticated drinking experience.
