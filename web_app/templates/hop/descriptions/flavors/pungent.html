<p>Pungent flavor is a desirable flavor in many styles of beer. This flavor is usually associated with strong, <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> notes and can be described as having a sharp, citrusy aroma. It is often found in <a href="/styles/ipa/">India Pale Ales</a> (<a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>), <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Double IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/american-porter-and-stout/imperial-stout/">Imperial Stouts</a>, and other hop-forward styles. Pungent hops are also used to balance out the sweetness of malt-forward beers such as Barleywines, Belgian <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">Strong Ales</a>, and <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/wee-heavy/">Scotch Ales</a>. The pungent flavor adds complexity to these beers and helps to create a more balanced overall taste.</p>
