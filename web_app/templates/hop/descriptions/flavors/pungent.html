<p>Pungent flavor is a desirable flavor in many styles of beer. This flavor is usually associated with strong, bitter notes and can be described as having a sharp, citrusy aroma. It is often found in India Pale Ales (IPAs), Double IPAs, Imperial Stouts, and other hop-forward styles. Pungent hops are also used to balance out the sweetness of malt-forward beers such as Barleywines, Belgian Strong Ales, and Scotch Ales. The pungent flavor adds complexity to these beers and helps to create a more balanced overall taste.</p>
