<p>The &quot;intense&quot; descriptor for beer hops is typically used to denote a strong, pronounced flavor and aroma contributed by the hops. This could range from bold citrus and tropical fruit notes to robust pine, spice, or floral characteristics. Such intensity is derived from specific hop varieties with high levels of essential oils and alpha acids, which, when used in brewing, can impart significant flavor and bitterness. Hops with these attributes are often added late in the brewing process or during dry-hopping to maximize their aromatic impact.</p>
