<p>Marmalade flavor is a unique and complex characteristic, resulting from the combination of citrusy and jammy notes. This flavor profile is typically associated with certain hop varieties such as <a href="/hops/aroma/amarillo/">Amarillo</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/citra/">Citra</a>, and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/mosaic/">Mosaic</a>. It is highly desirable in beer styles like <a href="/styles/ipa/new-england-ipa/">New England IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a>, and <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Double IPAs</a>, where the fruity and juicy flavors complement the hoppy bitterness. The marmalade character adds a sweet and tangy dimension, balancing the taste while enhancing the overall drinking experience.</p>
