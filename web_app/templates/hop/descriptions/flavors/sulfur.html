<p>Sulfur flavor is a desirable flavor in certain beer styles. It is a result of the sulfur compounds in hops, which are known as thiols and are responsible for giving beers their unique aromas and flavors. Sulfur flavors can range from earthy and herbal to floral and citrusy. The most common beer styles that benefit from sulfur flavors are lagers, pilsners, saisons, and Belgian ales. These beers often have a light, crisp taste that is complemented by the subtle sulfur notes.</p>
