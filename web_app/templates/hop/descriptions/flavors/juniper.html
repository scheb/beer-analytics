<p>Juniper-flavored hops are highly desirable in a variety of beer styles, most notably in traditional Scandinavian brews like <a href="/styles/historical-beer/sahti/">Sahti</a>. The incorporation of juniper imparts a distinct, resinous, and herbal character to the beer, complementing its malty and yeasty profile. In addition to Sahti, juniper-flavored hops can also enhance the taste of other beer styles such as Gruit, which relies on botanicals and herbs for bittering and flavoring instead of hops, as well as certain seasonal and experimental ales. The use of juniper in these beers creates a unique sensory experience, evoking the essence of the Scandinavian landscape and offering a refreshing alternative to more conventional hop profiles.</p>
