<p>Quince is a unique hop flavor that adds a tart, fruity note to beer. It is commonly used in Belgian-style ales, pale ales, and <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>. Quince has a distinct aroma of tart apples, apricots, and white wine grapes. It also has a slightly sweet flavor with hints of pear and melon. Quince hops can help to balance out the bitterness of other hop varieties while adding complexity to the beer's overall flavor profile. In addition to its use in beer, quince is also used to add flavor to cider, mead, and wine.</p>
