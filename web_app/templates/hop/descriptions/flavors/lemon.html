<p>Lemon flavor can be a desirable addition to certain beer styles, especially those that are light and refreshing. Some beer styles that often incorporate lemon include wheat beers, sour ales, shandies, and radlers. Wheat beers, such as Belgian <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">witbiers</a> and German hefeweizens, often have a citrusy character that can be complemented by the addition of lemon. Sour ales, which are already tart and tangy, can benefit from the bright acidity of lemon. Shandies and radlers, which are beer mixed with lemonade or other fruit juices, are specifically designed to incorporate a lemon flavor. However, lemon may not be desirable in all beer styles, and it is important to consider the overall balance and flavor profile of the beer when deciding whether to add lemon or not.</p>
