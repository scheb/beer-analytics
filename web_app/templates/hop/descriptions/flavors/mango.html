<p>Mango notes arise from specific aromatic compounds in hops, providing tropical fruit character to a beer's aroma and flavor. These mango-like nuances are especially desired in beer styles like <a href="/styles/ipa/new-england-ipa/">New England IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/ipa/american-ipa/">American IPAs</a>, and Pale Ales, where fruity and juicy profiles are sought after. Brewers often use hop varieties such as <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/citra/">Citra</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/mosaic/">Mosaic</a>, and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/galaxy/">Galaxy</a> to achieve these mango notes, which complement the beer's other fruity, citrus, and piney flavors. The presence of mango notes adds complexity and freshness to these beer styles, enhancing their overall drinking experience.</p>
