This flavor is particularly appreciated in Belgian and French beer styles, like <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a> and Bi√®res de Garde, where it contributes to the traditional spicy and earthy character. Additionally, German Pilsners and <a href="/styles/czech-lager/czech-premium-pale-lager/">Bohemian Pilsners</a> also can benefit from a subtle peppery note that accentuates their crisp and clean profile.</p>

Another hop, the <a href="/hops/aroma/styrian-golding/">Styrian Golding</a>, often used in <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>, can also contribute to a black pepper flavor.
