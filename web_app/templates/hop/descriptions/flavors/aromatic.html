<p>The aromatic descriptor for beer hops refers to the unique fragrance and flavor compounds that hops impart to a beer. This bouquet can encompass a wide array of characteristics, from floral, citrus, and spicy notes to more complex pine, tropical fruit, or earthy tones. Hops' aromatic properties come predominantly from their essential oils, which are released during the brewing process, especially during the later stages of boiling and dry hopping.
