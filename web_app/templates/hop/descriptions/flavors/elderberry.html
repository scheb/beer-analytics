<p>Elderberry flavor is a unique, fruity addition to many beer styles. It has a sweet and tart taste that adds complexity to the beer. It is often used in <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>, hefeweizens, <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, and other wheat beers. It can also be used to add a unique flavor to <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, stouts, and other dark beers. Elderberry hops can be used as either a bittering or aroma hop, depending on the desired flavor profile. In general, elderberry hops are best used in moderation to avoid overpowering other flavors in the beer.</p>
