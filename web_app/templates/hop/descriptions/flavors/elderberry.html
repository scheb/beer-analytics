<p>Elderberry flavor is a unique, fruity addition to many beer styles. It has a sweet and tart taste that adds complexity to the beer. It is often used in Belgian ales, hefeweizens, saisons, and other wheat beers. It can also be used to add a unique flavor to IPAs, stouts, and other dark beers. Elderberry hops can be used as either a bittering or aroma hop, depending on the desired flavor profile. In general, elderberry hops are best used in moderation to avoid overpowering other flavors in the beer.</p>
