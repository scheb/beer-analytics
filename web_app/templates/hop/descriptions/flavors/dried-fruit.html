<p>Dried fruit flavors in beer are often desirable in styles where a rich, rounded, and complex malt character is paramount. These include styles such as Belgian <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/british-strong-ale/">Strong Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/english-barleywine/">English Barleywines</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-british-ale/old-ale/">Old Ales</a>, and some darker and maltier American craft styles. Dried fruit characteristics provide a counterpoint to the malt sweetness, adding depth and complexity. This flavor can be achieved through the use of hops like East Kent Goldings, which can impart notes of dried fruit when used in the boil, and some New World hops like <a href="/hops/aroma/amarillo/">Amarillo</a>, which has been noted for its dried apricot characteristics when used for dry hopping.</p>

<p>Hops not only contribute to the bitterness and aroma of the beer but also influence its flavor profile. Certain hops can lend a dried fruit-like quality to beer, particularly when used in larger quantities or during specific stages of the brewing process, such as the whirlpool or dry hopping stages. These flavors can vary from dried citrus to dried stone fruit, and even dried berries depending on the hop variety. It's worth noting that dried fruit character can be quite desirable in <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPA</a> variants like <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Double IPAs</a> and <a href="/styles/ipa/new-england-ipa/">New England IPAs</a>, where the interplay between the fruity yeast esters and hop-derived fruit flavors can create a complex and intensely fruity beer.</p>
