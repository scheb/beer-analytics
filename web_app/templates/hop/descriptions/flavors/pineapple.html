<p>Pineapple flavor can be a desirable characteristic in various beer styles, particularly those that emphasize fruity and tropical notes. This includes <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, and various fruit-infused beers. The addition of pineapple in these styles enhances their natural hop-driven tropical flavors, while adding a touch of sweetness and acidity. Pineapple also works well in sour beer styles, such as <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/berliner-weisse/">Berliner Weisse</a> and <a href="/styles/historical-beer/gose/">Gose</a>, where its tangy taste complements the tartness of the base beer. Some brewers even experiment with pineapple in unconventional styles, such as stouts or porters, to create unique and innovative flavor profiles. Overall, pineapple flavor can be an appealing feature in a range of beers, bringing a refreshing and exotic twist to traditional styles.</p>
