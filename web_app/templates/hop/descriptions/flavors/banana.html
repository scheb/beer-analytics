<p>Banana flavors in beer are typically derived from esters produced by yeast during fermentation rather than from hops. These flavors are particularly desirable in traditional <a href="/styles/german-wheat-beer/">German wheat beers</a>, such as Hefeweizens and <a href="/styles/german-wheat-beer/weissbier/">Weissbiers</a>, as well as Belgian-style beers like <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/witbier/">Witbiers</a> and certain Abbey ales. The banana notes in these styles are often accompanied by other fruity esters, such as clove or bubblegum, which together create a unique and enjoyable taste profile. Although not typically found in hop-forward styles, the banana flavor can add complexity and depth to the overall sensory experience of these classic beer styles, enhancing their fruity and spicy characteristics.</p>
