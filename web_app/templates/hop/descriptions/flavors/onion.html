<p>Onion flavor is an interesting, yet subtle flavor that can be found in certain styles of beer. It is most commonly found in Belgian-style ales and <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">saisons</a>, where the onion-like character lends a unique complexity to the beer. The onion flavor comes from a variety of hop varieties, such as Styrian Goldings, <a href="/hops/aroma/saaz/">Saaz</a>, and Hallertau Mittelfr√ºh. These hops are used to impart a spicy, herbal character to the beer that has been likened to onion or garlic. Onion flavor in beer hops can also be used to balance out sweet malt flavors, adding depth and complexity to the finished product.</p>
