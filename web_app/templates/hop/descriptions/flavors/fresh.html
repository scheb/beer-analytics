<p>The &quot;fresh&quot; descriptor refers to aromas and flavors reminiscent of fresh herbs, grass, or floral elements, often imparting a refreshing quality to the beer. This characteristic is highly desirable in styles such as Pilsners, <a href="/styles/ipa/">India Pale Ales</a> (<a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>), and Pale Ales, where hop presence is accentuated. The fresh quality lends itself to the crisp, clean flavors these styles are renowned for, enhancing their overall drinking experience.</p>
