<p>Lychee notes refer to the subtle, fruity flavors reminiscent of the tropical lychee fruit, which boasts a delicate balance of sweetness and tartness. These flavors can enhance the overall character of certain beer styles, particularly when paired with complementary hop profiles. Lychee notes are desirable in beer styles such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, Pale Ales, and <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>. In <a href="/styles/ipa/">IPAs</a> and Pale Ales, the lychee's sweet and tart flavors complement the hoppy, citrusy character, adding complexity and depth. In Saisons, the fruity lychee notes can provide a refreshing contrast to the beer's spicy, earthy undertones.</p>
