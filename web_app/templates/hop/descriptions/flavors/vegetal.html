<p>Vegetal flavor is a desirable trait in some beer styles, such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, Pale Ales, and Lagers. This flavor can be imparted by hops like <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/cascade/">Cascade</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/centennial/">Centennial</a>, <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/chinook/">Chinook</a>, and <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/columbus/">Columbus</a>. The vegetal flavor adds a unique complexity to the beer that can range from grassy and herbal notes to spicy or onion-like aromas.
