<p>Sage is a unique, aromatic herb that imparts an earthy, slightly peppery flavor to beer hops, adding complexity to the overall taste profile. This distinctive flavor is particularly desirable in certain beer styles, such as <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a>, Farmhouse Ales, and Herb-infused Ales. The sage-infused hops contribute a refreshing herbal character that complements the fruity, spicy, and yeasty notes found in these styles. In addition, the herbaceous qualities of sage can also enhance the crisp, clean finish in well-hopped Pilsners and light Lagers. The incorporation of sage in beer hops creates a memorable drinking experience, appealing to craft beer enthusiasts who enjoy unique, innovative brews.</p>
