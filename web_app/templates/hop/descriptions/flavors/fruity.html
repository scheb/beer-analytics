<p>Fruity flavors are desirable in various beer styles, as they can add complexity and depth to the overall taste profile. Some examples include <a href="/styles/belgian-ale/">Belgian ales</a>, such as Dubbels, Tripels, and Quadrupels, which often have notes of banana, pear, or apple. <a href="/styles/fruit-beer-variants/fruit-beer/">Fruit beers</a> and radlers, on the other hand, are intentionally brewed with fruit, providing a refreshing, fruit-forward experience. <a href="/styles/strong-belgian-ale/saison/">Saisons</a> and farmhouse ales may also showcase fruity esters, imparting flavors like citrus or stone fruit. Furthermore, certain <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, particularly those featuring New England or hazy styles, emphasize tropical and citrus fruit flavors derived from hops. Fruity flavors can also be found in some sour styles, such as <a href="/styles/european-sour-ale/berliner-weisse/">Berliner Weisse</a> or <a href="/styles/historical-beer/gose/">Gose</a>, which may incorporate fruit additions or exhibit fruity esters from fermentation. Ultimately, the appeal of fruity flavors in beer is their ability to add balance, character, and a pleasant aroma, enhancing the overall drinking experience.</p>
