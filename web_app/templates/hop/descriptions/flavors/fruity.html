<p>Fruity flavors are desirable in various beer styles, as they can add complexity and depth to the overall taste profile. Some examples include Belgian ales, such as Dubbels, Tripels, and Quadrupels, which often have notes of banana, pear, or apple. Fruit beers and radlers, on the other hand, are intentionally brewed with fruit, providing a refreshing, fruit-forward experience. Saisons and farmhouse ales may also showcase fruity esters, imparting flavors like citrus or stone fruit. Furthermore, certain IPAs, particularly those featuring New England or hazy styles, emphasize tropical and citrus fruit flavors derived from hops. Fruity flavors can also be found in some sour styles, such as Berliner Weisse or Gose, which may incorporate fruit additions or exhibit fruity esters from fermentation. Ultimately, the appeal of fruity flavors in beer is their ability to add balance, character, and a pleasant aroma, enhancing the overall drinking experience.</p>
