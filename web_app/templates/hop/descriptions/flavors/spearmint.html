<p>Spearmint is a unique flavor, adding a refreshing and minty taste to the brew. It is desirable in light-bodied beers such as pilsners, lagers, and pale ales, where it can bring out the floral and herbal notes of the beer. Spearmint also pairs well with fruity flavors like citrus and stone fruit, making it an ideal addition to wheat beers, IPAs, and sours. The spearmint flavor can be quite subtle when used in small amounts, but it can add a unique twist to any beer style.</p>
