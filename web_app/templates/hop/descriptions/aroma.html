<p>Aroma hops are a type of hop variety specifically cultivated for their aromatic qualities in beer brewing. Rich in essential oils, these hops impart distinct flavors and fragrances to the beer, such as floral, fruity, citrus, or spicy notes, without contributing significantly to bitterness. They are primarily used during the later stages of the brewing process, typically during the last 5 to 20 minutes of the boil, or added during whirlpooling or dry hopping, to maximize their aroma contributions while minimizing the extraction of <a href="/styles/british-bitter/ordinary-bitter/">bitter</a> alpha acids.</p>

<p>The use of aroma hops is vital in crafting a beer's sensory profile, particularly for styles that emphasize hop-forward flavors and aromas like <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, pale ales, and pilsners. By carefully selecting and combining different aroma hop varieties, brewers can create a unique, well-rounded, and complex beer character that appeals to the taste preferences of beer enthusiasts.</p>
