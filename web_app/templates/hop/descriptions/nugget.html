<p><em>Nugget</em> hops have been a staple in the brewing industry since their introduction in the early 1980s. Developed by the USDA Breeding Program in Oregon, this hop variety is a cross between the <a href="/hops/bittering/brewers-gold/">Brewer's Gold</a> and a high alpha-acid male hop. <em>Nugget</em> hops quickly gained popularity due to their impressive dual-purpose profile, offering both high alpha acids and an appealing aroma. With a robust and well-rounded character, these hops are perfect for brewing various beer styles, such as American Ales, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, Stouts, and Barleywines.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Nugget</em> hops is characterized by its earthy, herbal, and slightly spicy notes, which add a delightful complexity to your homebrews. Boasting an alpha acid content typically ranging from 12-14%, <em>Nugget</em> hops contribute a firm and clean bitterness to the beer. The moderate aroma profile, on the other hand, showcases subtle hints of wood, pine, and floral qualities, which can add a touch of finesse to your creations. Given their versatility, <em>Nugget</em> hops can be used throughout the brewing process, from bittering to late-addition aroma hopping, making them an excellent option for both single-hop and multi-hop recipes. Whether you're brewing a hop-forward <a href="/styles/ipa/">IPA</a> or a more balanced American Ale, <em>Nugget</em> hops will undoubtedly provide an exceptional foundation for your next homebrew project.</p>
