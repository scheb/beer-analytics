<p><strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops, a relatively new hop variety, were developed by Hopsteiner Breeding Program and first introduced to the market in 2012. This hop variety is a result of crossing Cascade and a US male variety. As the name suggests, <strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops have a unique lemon-citrus character, which has made them increasingly popular among both commercial and homebrewers alike. They are known for their high myrcene content, contributing to their distinct aroma and flavor. With an alpha acid range of 5-7% and beta acids around 4-6%, <strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops are versatile and suitable for a wide array of beer styles.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops is predominantly characterized by its bright and zesty lemon notes, accompanied by undertones of green tea, mint, and a subtle herbal quality. This makes them an excellent choice for beers that benefit from a refreshing citrus character, such as American Pale Ales, IPAs, Saisons, and Wheat beers. In addition to aroma and flavor, <strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops also impart a mild, clean bitterness, which balances well with the sweet malt backbone in various beer styles. As a dual-purpose hop, <strong>Lemondrop</strong> can be used in both the early boil for bittering and later in the whirlpool or as a dry-hop addition for its enticing aroma.</p>

<p>For homebrewers looking to experiment with <strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops, consider using them in combination with other hop varieties to create a complex and layered hop profile. Some popular pairings include Citra, Mosaic, and Amarillo, which can accentuate and complement the lemony, citrus notes of <strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops. When using <strong>Lemondrop</strong> hops in your brew, remember to adjust the timing of your hop additions to achieve the desired balance of bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Happy brewing!</p>
