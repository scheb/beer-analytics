<p><em>Simcoe</em> hops, first introduced to the brewing world in 2000 by Yakima Chief Ranches, have become a favorite among craft brewers and homebrewers alike. Developed by Select Botanicals Group, these hops are a proprietary blend of several hop varieties, including <a href="/hops/bittering/brewers-gold/">Brewer's Gold</a>, <a href="/hops/aroma/cascade/">Cascade</a>, and a wild hop native to New Mexico.</p>

<p><em>Simcoe</em> hops boast a complex flavor profile, characterized by their strong piney and resinous notes, as well as citrusy and fruity undertones. These hops also exhibit hints of earthiness and berry, resulting in a multifaceted taste experience. <em>Simcoe</em> hops are widely appreciated for their dual-purpose nature, serving as both a bittering and an aroma hop. With a typical alpha acid content ranging from 12-14% and a beta acid content of 4-5%, they are well-suited for adding a clean, crisp bitterness to your brew.</p>

<p>Homebrewers find <em>Simcoe</em> hops particularly useful in crafting hop-forward beer styles such as <a href="/styles/pale-american-ale/american-pale-ale/">American Pale Ales</a>, <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, and <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">Double IPAs</a>, where their unique flavor and aroma profiles truly shine. <em>Simcoe</em> hops also work exceptionally well in combination with other hop varieties, contributing to the creation of countless unique and experimental brews. Whether you're a novice homebrewer or an experienced brewmaster, incorporating <em>Simcoe</em> hops into your recipes will undoubtedly enhance your beer's complexity and depth, taking your brewing endeavors to new heights.</p>
