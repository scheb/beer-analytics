<p><em>Akoya</em> is a type of hop used in brewing beer that is grown primarily in Japan. It is a relatively new variety of hop that was developed in the early 2000s by the Sapporo Brewery. <em>Akoya</em> hops are known for their unique flavor profile, which is characterized by notes of citrus, earthy spice, and a slightly bitter finish. They also have a relatively low alpha acid content, making them ideal for use in aroma and flavor additions to beer rather than for bitterness.</p>

<p>The name "Akoya" is derived from the Japanese word for pearl, which is fitting given the hop's origins in the coastal region of Hokkaido. <em>Akoya</em> hops are highly sought after by brewers around the world who are looking to add a unique twist to their beer recipes. They are especially popular in lighter beer styles, such as pilsners and lagers, where their delicate flavor can shine through without being overwhelmed by other ingredients. If you're a beer enthusiast looking to try something new, be sure to seek out a brew made with <em>Akoya</em> hops for a truly unique taste experience.</p>
