<p><em>Centennial</em> hops, a popular variety among homebrewers and craft breweries alike, were first developed in the United States by the USDA breeding program in the late 20th century. They were released in 1990 as a part of the program's centennial celebration, hence the name "<em>Centennial</em>" hops. This variety is the result of a crossbreeding between <a href="/hops/bittering/brewers-gold/">Brewer's Gold</a> and a selected USDA male, and it is primarily grown in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. <em>Centennial</em> hops are revered for their versatility, acting as both a bittering and aroma hop that can be utilized throughout the brewing process.</p>

<p>The flavor profile of <em>Centennial</em> hops is characterized by its strong floral and citrus notes, particularly grapefruit. It is often compared to <a href="/hops/aroma/cascade/">Cascade</a> hops, with <em>Centennial</em> sometimes being referred to as "Super Cascade" due to its higher alpha acid content, which typically ranges between 9.5% and 11.5%. This higher alpha acid content makes <em>Centennial</em> hops an excellent choice for bittering, while its aromatic qualities add depth and character to a brew's aroma and flavor.</p>

<p><em>Centennial</em> hops are well-suited for a wide range of beer styles, from Pale Ales and <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a> to Stouts and Porters. In particular, they are a key component in American-style Pale Ales and <a href="/styles/ipa/">IPAs</a>, where their pronounced citrus and floral characteristics perfectly complement the malt backbone of these beers. For homebrewers, <em>Centennial</em> hops are a great choice for experimenting with various beer styles, providing a reliable and balanced bitterness, as well as a bright, zesty aroma that is sure to please beer enthusiasts.</p>
