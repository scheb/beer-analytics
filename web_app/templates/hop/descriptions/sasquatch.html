<p><em>Sasquatch</em> hops, also known as the experimental hop variety HBC 431, is a proprietary hop strain developed by Yakima Chief Hops in collaboration with breweries and farmers. This hop strain is named after the mythical <em>Sasquatch</em> creature, which is said to roam the forests of the Pacific Northwest. <em>Sasquatch</em> hops were first released in 2013, and they have gained popularity among craft brewers due to their unique aroma and flavor profile.</p>

<p><em>Sasquatch</em> hops are known for their complex flavor and aroma characteristics, which include notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, and earthy spice. They also have a relatively high alpha acid content, which makes them suitable for use in both bittering and aroma additions. <em>Sasquatch</em> hops are often used in hop-forward beer styles, such as IPAs, pale ales, and double IPAs, to add a distinctive aroma and flavor profile to the beer. Due to their popularity and limited availability, <em>Sasquatch</em> hops can be quite expensive and may be difficult to find outside of certain regions.</p>
