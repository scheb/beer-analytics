<p><em>Galaxy</em> hops are a popular variety of hops that originated in Australia, specifically from the Hop Products Australia breeding program. First introduced in 2009, <em>Galaxy</em> quickly gained popularity among craft brewers and homebrewers alike due to its distinct flavor. The hop cultivar is a cross between <a href="/hops/dual-purpose/perle/">Perle</a>, a German hop variety, and an Australian high alpha acid female hop, which is progeny of the variety <a href="/hops/bittering/pride-of-ringwood/">Pride of Ringwood</a>.</p>

<p><em>Galaxy</em> hops are known for their intense tropical fruit characteristics, with passionfruit, peach, and citrus notes being the most prominent. They also exhibit subtle undertones of pineapple, mango, and melon, as well as a touch of grassiness. This powerful flavor profile makes <em>Galaxy</em> hops an excellent choice for late additions in the brewing process, including whirlpool and dry hopping, where they can contribute a significant burst of aroma and flavor to the final beer. Due to their high alpha acid content, typically ranging from 12 to 16%, they can also be used for bittering, although their true potential shines in aroma and flavor contributions.</p>

<p>These hops are particularly well-suited for hop-forward beer styles such as <a href="/styles/pale-commonwealth-beer/english-ipa/">IPAs</a>, <a href="/styles/strong-american-ale/double-ipa/">double IPAs</a>, and pale ales, where their tropical and citrus flavors can be showcased to great effect. However, their versatility means they can also be used to enhance the character of a wide range of other beer styles, including lagers, wheat beers, and even stouts. For homebrewers, incorporating <em>Galaxy</em> hops into your brewing repertoire can add a new dimension of flavor and aroma, making your beers truly stand out. Experiment with different combinations and hop schedules to find the perfect balance that highlights the exceptional qualities of this remarkable hop variety.</p>
