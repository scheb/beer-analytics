<p><em>Moutere</em>, previously known as experimental hop HORT 0605, is a relatively new hop variety that was first introduced in 2015 by New Zealand's hop breeding program under the name &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, but later renamed. It was named after the <em>Moutere</em> Hills region in the northern part of New Zealand's South Island, where it was first cultivated. <em>Moutere</em> hops are known for their intense tropical fruit aroma and flavor, with notes of passionfruit, guava, and citrus.</p>

<p><em>Moutere</em> hops have a high oil content, which contributes to their unique flavor profile. They also have a high alpha acid content, making them a versatile hop that can be used for both bittering and aroma. <em>Moutere</em> hops are typically used in pale ales, IPAs, and other hop-forward beer styles. Brewers appreciate the complexity and depth of flavor that <em>Moutere</em> hops bring to their beers, and they are becoming increasingly popular among craft breweries around the world.</p>
